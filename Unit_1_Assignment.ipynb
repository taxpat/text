              "'INTRODUCTION Make and buy decisions are familiar issues for accountants . Often the problem is cast as a choice between either making or buying an input . While the make versus buy decision is indeed reective of some circumstances manufacturing rms often opt to both make and buy inputs . That is rms purchase some inputs from external suppliers while relying on inhouse production for others they nd areas of specialization and outsource those for which theyhave no discernable expertise . In this paper we examine such sourcing circumstances and demonstrate that informationalreasons can result in the costs of made inputs and the cost of outsourced inputs to interact . In particular higher internal makecosts credibly commit a rm to be tough in procurement negotiations with its external supplier . This in turn undercuts the suppliers incentive to acquire and misreport private information that would have given it an edge in negotiations . Broadly stated internal production inefciencies come with a silver lining for the rm by dissuading a supplier of outsourced inputsfrom gaining an information upper hand . Formally the paper models a rm that sells a product requiring two inputs . The rm makes one input input minternally and buys the other input input bfrom an external supplier . The rm can control the cost of input mby investing upfront in a new technology the greater the rms investment in the new technology the lower its marginal cost of made inputs . The rm isalso concerned with what it pays to procure input bfrom the supplier . Here it confronts an informational problem the supplier can install an information system e.g . undertake an activitybased costing analysis to provide it with more precise private information about input bs cost . The precision of the information system is naturally tied to the suppliers spending on the system . When the suppliers information system proves ineffective and leaves it no better informed buying inputs from it is We thank Mary E.

Submitted November 2018 Accepted January 2021 Published Online March 2021 29straightforward for the rm . When the supplier is privately informed the rm optimally offers a menu of contracts each of which prescribes price and quantity of trade . The supplier selects from this menu via its selfreported cost . Following contract selection the rm buys the contracted units of input bmakes an equal number of input mand combines them to create an output . The focus of the model is on how the rms costcutting investment in the new technology inuences the suppliersinformation acquisition and reporting decisions and the terms of trade in light of adverse selection . To provide intuition for the economic forces we begin with a binary version of the model the suppliers cost is low or high and its information acquisition decision is a discrete one whether to install a given information system . Moreover the suppliers cost of installing the system and the rms cost of investing in the new technology are each assumed to be arbitrarily small ensuring that the information acquisition and investment decisions are driven solely by informationgrounded incentiveconsiderations . In this simplied setting when the rm faces an informed supplier the usual productionversusrents tradeoff leaves the rm with two options . It can offer a Slack contract i.e . offer to pay a high price that ensures the supplier will always agree to trade but one that offers the supplier potential information rents . Alternatively it can offer a Rationing contracti.e . offer to buy only at a low price under which the supplier agrees to trade only when its own cost is low but which eliminates information rents . The absence of supplier rents with the Rationing contract means it provides the rm with an upside ex ante it disincentivizes the supplier from acquiring private information leaving the rm and its supplier on level information footing in negotiating trade terms . Critically the rms threat to ration is only credible when its potential prots from the sale of the nished product are limited . After all with high prots forgoing trade is not optimal for the rm recognizing this the supplier will seek to acquire private information so as to secure information rents . By investing less in the new technology i.e . ensuring higher marginal cost of made inputs the rm can curtail product protability sufciently that Rationing is credible as the response to aninformed supplier . Of course when revenues are signicant this strategy imposes a substantial burden on the rms make operation and thus would not be worthwhile . At the other extreme when revenues are low the commitment to Rationing is already natural without making inhouse operations expensive . In short the rms investment decision is altered only for intermediate revenue values . For these values a modestly higher marginal cost on the make side can commit the rm to aggressive trade terms an action that sties the suppliers incentives to acquire private information and thus secures morethanoffsetting gains for the rm on the buy side . The fundamental tradeoffs and interaction between the make and buy costs established in the binary setting applies in the more general continuous setting modeled in the paper . The equilibrium characterization and the accompanying comparative statics in the continuous case reiterate and reinforce the intuition . In particular the more the rms marginal cost of made inputs 1 the stricter its buy offer to the informed supplier and 2 the lower is the chosen precision of the suppliersinformation system due to the availability of lower information rents . As a consequence the rms equilibrium investment in costcutting technology is lower than if the suppliers information acquisition choice was taken as exogenous . In the above analysis we presume that the rm learns whether the suppliers information system is effective i.e . whether the supplier is informed although it is not privy to the specic cost information that the informed supplier obtains . This assumption permits us to focus squarely on the novel aspect of our modelsupplier incentives for information acquisitionwhile employing familiar optimal contracts from the standard adverse selection literature e.g . Harris Kriebel and Raviv 1982 Antle and Eppen 1985 Antle and Fellingham 1995 Rajan and Reichelstein 2004 . However we also demonstrate that the results are not sensitive to this assumption . Specically we extend the analysis to a setting where the rm does not even knowwhether the supplier it contracts with is uninformed or informed . While this maybe informed setting complicates the determination of the optimal contract as in e.g . Cremer and Khalil 1994 Cremer Khalil and Rochet 1998 we again identify the intermediate revenue values for which the rms equilibrium make and buy costs interact in that the rm settles on a higher marginal cost of making in order to lower its expected payment for the outsourced input . Finally we devote a section to discuss some additional applications of the overall theme that internal weaknesses can put the rm in a position of external strength when negotiating with a potentially privately informed party . While our model incorporates internal weakness through inefciencies in the cost of making an input the implications of our model apply more generally to other forms of weaknesses that lower the products unit margin but not to others in which the rm simply burns money without affecting the products unit margins . The key is whether the introduced inefciency impacts the rms marginal benets of securing units when negotiating contract terms with the third party . Our study builds on and adds to several streams of literature . In terms of incentive design in adverse selection models Antle and Eppen 1985 applying the seminal Harris et al . 1982 framework to a capital budgeting and procurement setting demonstrate that the production versus rents tradeoff is captured by a simple bangbang contract the binarytype equivalent of which are the Slack and Rationing contracts . Subsequent papers have studied variants including for example the principals design of information system e.g . Antle and Fellingham 1995 Arya Glover and Sivaramakrishnan 1997 contracting over multiple periods Antle and Fellingham 1990 Dutta and Reichelstein 2002 delegated contracting and the design of responsibility centers e.g . Melumad Mookherjee and Reichelstein 1992 Mookherjee and Reichelstein 1997 30 Arya Mittendorf and Ramanan The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022transfer pricing e.g . Vaysman 1996 and supplier relations Lewis and Sappington 1991 Cachon and Lariviere 1999 . For an excellent survey of this literature see Rajan and Reichelstein 2004 . These adverse selection models presume the agent is privately informed and focus on the mechanism design problem to optimally extract the information from the agent . Our paper steps back and examines the agents i.e . suppliers decision to become privately informed in the rst place . Studies that examine information acquisition decisions include Shavell 1994 Arya Gong and Ramanan 2014 and Dye 2017 who each demonstrate in different settings that discretion in disclosure can lead to excessive information acquisition . When disclosure is mandatory Schneider and Scholze 2015 demonstrate that there can be underacquisition of information when there is a concern with information falling into the wrong hands . In contrast to these studies that assume truthful reporting we examine information acquisition in an adverse selection context in which the supplier can potentially pad and misreport cost information to the buyer . In this sense our study is related to Cremer and Khalil 1994 andCremer Khalil and Rochet 1998 who show how the optimal contract changes in light of information acquisition by a contracting party . Relative to these and the other adverse selection papers that have followed Baron and Myerson 1982 our paper adds that it may also be optimal to distort the rms real actions here investment in cost cutting in order to curb the agents incentives to acquire private information and subsequently report it in selfinterest . Moreover the rms distortion occurs on a front theinternally produced input that is seemingly independent of the problem plagued by information concerns the outsourced input . Our study is also related to the literature on strategic outsourcing . Several papers discuss circumstances wherein a simple makecost versus buycost comparison may be inadequate to capture the full impact of the outsourcing decision . Such considerations include predatory pricing by suppliers Marx and Shaffer 1999 gains due to learningbydoing Chen 2005 revelation of proprietary information Demski and Sappington 1993 outsourcing to a common supplier to avoid redundant xed costs Shy and Stenbacka 2003 or to disadvantage rivals Salop and Scheffman 1987 and the reduction in investment incentives of independent suppliers when a rm has the option to source internally Loertscher and Riordan 2019 .Arya and Mittendorf 2007 show that higher internal transfer prices can reduce a decentralized rms willingness to pay its supplier leading the supplier to cut wholesale price . In Arya and Mittendorf 2007 there is no private information and the monopolist supplier has sole discretion over the price . In contrast the acquisition and exploitation of private information by the supplier and the rms offer of trade terms are the focus of the current paper . The rest of this paper proceeds as follows . Section II models the problems of 1 the rms investment in new technology that impacts the marginal cost of the input it makes inhouse 2 the suppliers acquisition of private cost information for theinput the rm buys and 3 the rm and the suppliers contract governing trade terms . Section III considers a binary version of the model and provides intuition for the economic forces by demonstrating how increasing the cost of the makeinput can limit supplier rents . Section IV conrms this intuition more generally by deriving the equilibrium and key comparative statics for theprimary setting . Section V extends the analysis to a more severe information problem in which the rm is not even aware of whether its supplier becomes privately informed . Section VI offers additional implications and interpretations of the models ndings . Section VII concludes . II . MODEL Firms often rely jointly on inhouse manufacturing and outsourcing for key inputs . To model such dual sourcing paths simply consider a riskneutral rm that buys one input input b and makes another input m. The rm then combines xunits of each of these inputs x20XC138to assemble xunits of an output that generates revenue of Rper unit . Here Xdenotes the rms production capacity i.e . the maximum number of units the rm can assemble . This familiar upperbound lineartechnology formulation and the modeling of the ensuing adverse selection problem was initiated in Antle and Eppen 1985 and subsequently employed by its many variants e.g . Antle and Fellingham 1995 . 1 For the input it makes the rms default marginal cost of production is C22k . However the rm has the option to adopt a new technology to lower this cost . Specically by investing an upfront xed cost wkin this technology the cost is lowered to C22kC0kper unit where k20C22kC138w0k.0 and w00kC210 . For the input it buys the rm is concerned with curtailing payments to a riskneutral external supplier who may gain private information about its own costs or equivalently its opportunity costs tied to nextbest use of capacity . In particularthe suppliers uncertain unit cost of producing input bis given by the random variable c20C22cC138w i t h fandFrepresenting the PDF and CDF respectively of the distribution of c. While the supplier initially does not know the precise production cost of b it can try to learn cby installing an information system e.g . investing in an activitybased costing analysis . The precision of the information system i.e . the probability with which it reveals cis denoted by kk201C138The suppliers cost of installing 1The capacity constraint Xensures nite production quantities in the intuitive linear adverse selection model . In Appendix B we derive the results without capacity constraints in a nonlinear framework as in say the adverse selection model originally studied in Baron and Myerson [ 1982 ] .In Defense of Limited Manufacturing Cost Control Disciplining Acquisition of Private Information by Suppliers 31 The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022 an information system of precision kis given by vk with v0k.0 and v00kC210 . Broadly viewed the modeled uncertainty and information system design reects the fact that the supplier may not be fully informed of a specic products marginal costs either because of the imprecision of the installed system or because the system may reveal the cost accurately only inaggregate across its operations and product lines in the latter case the splitting of costs into xed and variable components and the issue of allocating shared costs introduces natural uncertainty in a particular products true marginal cost . While all parties observe whether the information system proves effective in determining the suppliers cost it is only the supplier that is privy to the precise cvalue that the effective system reveals in Section V we consider a more severe information problem in which the rm not only does not know the suppliers cost information but does not even know if the supplier is privately informed . This private information then introduces the possibility of the supplier earning information rentsby padding its cost reports . Specically when the supplier is uninformed the rm offers a contract fxtgto the supplier i.e . the rm offers to buy xunits of input battper unit . When facing an informed supplier the optimal mechanism entails the rm offering a menu of contracts fx^ct^cg^c20C22cC138 from which the supplier selects one contract . Equivalently stated the rm commits to quantity and payment terms contingent on the suppliers selfreported cost ^c The sequence of events is as follows . First the rm invests wkto adopt a new technology . Second the supplier incurs vkin information acquisition . Third the rm and the supplier contract on trade terms . In the event of trade xunits of input b are procured by the rm at cost txand this input is combined with xunits of input mat cost C22kC0kC138xto create xunits of the output that is sold in the market for Rx . Thus the rms prot is P FRC0C22kC0kC0tC138xC0wkand the suppliers prot is PStC0cC138xC0vk . To ensure production is optimal absent supplier private information and to ensure interior solution in the informed supplier setting we assume that Max E fcg C22kC22cC8C9 RC22cHC22c where HcFcfcis the hazard rate that satises the standard assumption H0c.0 . This monotone hazard rate condition is satised by several distributions such as uniform normal logistic Chisquared exponential and Laplace . In adverse selection models this assumption allows global incentive compatibility constraints to be replaced by their local counterparts see for example Bagnoli and Bergstrom 2005 Laffont and Tirole 1994 . Figure 1 summarizes the sequence of events . III . INTUITION THE BINARY SETTING In order to provide intuition for the economic forces in play this section examines a binary version of the model . In particular let c20C22cfg represent the suppliers uncertain cost with pdenoting the probability that cC22c . Also let k20C22kC8C9 C22kC201 with v00 and vC22k 0 . In effect either the information system is 1 not installed or 2 installed at an arbitrarily small cost to reveal cwith probability C22kto the supplier . This deliberate choice of an almost costless information system ensures that it is the incentives provided by the rm that are critical to the suppliers information acquisition decision . In similar spirit we assume wk 0 for all k20C22kC138 ensuring that the only reason the rm will not minimize the cost of the input it makes is if the higher cost aids in providing appropriate incentives to the supplier . Turning to the optimal contract if the rm confronts an uninformed supplier its offer is straightforward xXand tEfcgpC22c . Clearly an uninformed supplier has no reason to decline this production at expected cost offer . When the rm contracts with an informed supplier it has two options to optimally conduct the productionversusrents tradeoff typical in adverse selection settings . One option is to offer the supplier a Slack contract wherein the rm sets x^cXandt^c C22cfor both the highcost ^cC22c and the lowcost supplier report ^c0 . The supplier has no reason to decline this offer or to misreport this offerFIGURE 1 Timeline32 Arya Mittendorf and Ramanan The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022ensures that Xunits are purchased from the supplier with certainty . Thus under the Slack contract the rms payoff is RC0C22kC0kC0C22cC138X The other option is for the rm to offer a Rationing contract wherein the rm trades if and only if the supplier submits a lowcost report ^c0 by offering the menu x^c0X t^c00a n d x^cC22c0t^cC22c0 . In this case a lowcost supplier does not benet from padding its report and thus misreporting incentives are eliminated . On the one hand this contractallows the rm to eliminate the suppliers information rents . On the other hand the rm commits to forgoing production when the suppliers cost is high . That is under Rationing trade only occurs with probability 1 C0pi.e . if c0 . In effect under Rationing with probability 1 C0pthe rm is able to procure and sell Xunits but with probability pit makes no sale at all for it is unable to procure input b.T h i s bangbang no trade or full trade nature of the Rationing contract ensures that the rms expected payoff under this contract is 1C0pC138RC0C22kC0kC138X . As established in Appendix A these two contracts capture the full range of possibilities in that the rms optimal contract to an informed supplier in the binary setting is assured to be either Slack or Rationing . Comparing the Slack versus Rationing payoff expressions the rm offers a Slack contract if and only if R. C22kC0kC138C22cp 1 Next we turn to the suppliers incentive to become informed . Naturally this decision is driven by the contract the supplier expects to be offered when informed . If it anticipates a Slack contract then it invests in the information system to earn potentialinformation rents . However if it anticipates the Rationing contract then its rents are guaranteed to be zero and thus it is unwilling to incur even the arbitrarily small cost to install the information system . In effect since a Slack contract follows if and only if 1 is satised the supplier acquires information only in that circumstance . Now consider the rms investment wkin the new technology that cuts its cost to make input mfrom C22ktoC22kC0k . Since condition 1 dictates the suppliers information acquisition decision the presence of kin 1 provides an avenue for the rm to affect the suppliers decision to become privately informed . Specically when makecosts are high enough that 1 is not satised i.e . investment in the new technology is sufciently low the rm can credibly commit to being less generous in itsbuyoffer to the supplier . Formally choosing lower costcutting investment has the downside of raising the cost of input mbut can have the upside of committing the rm to the Rationing contract when facing an informed supplier . After all whenRationing is in the ofng the supplier will choose to remain uninformed i.e . the rm does not even confront an adverse selection problem when wkis low enough that the condition in 1 is violated . In terms of the rms optimal investment suppose RC20C22cp . In this case even if the rm undertakes the maximum cost cutting initiative wC22ks o C22kC0k0 the condition in 1 is not satised . That is for these low Rvalues the rm can credibly commit to the Rationing contract when facing an informed supplier even while making its input efciently . Given that the supplier is sure to receive a Rationing contract if informed it prefers to not acquire private information . As a consequence in equilibrium the rm invests wC22k confronts only an uninformed supplier and guarantees trade of xXunits via the offer oftpC22cresulting in expected rm payoff of RC0p C22cC138X . Now suppose R.C22cp . In this case the rm can follow one of two paths . It can incentivize the supplier to remain uninformed by threatening to offer a Rationing contract were the supplier to become informed . As noted earlier this threat to ration is only credible if 1 is not satised . With R.C22cpthis requires that the rm not undertake the investment that maximally cuts the make cost but rather choose wksuch that kC22kC0RC0C22cp i.e . cut makecost only to the extent that 1 holds as an equality . This arrangement results in the rm encountering an uninformed supplier guaranteeing trade of xX units via tpC22cand earning the rm expected prot of RC0C22kC0kC0pC22cC138XC22cpC0pC22cC138X . Alternatively the rm can engage in maximum costcutting for the input it makes recognizing that it will result in the supplier investing in information acquisition . If the supplier is successful in learning its input cost then the rm optimallyoffers the Slack contract i.e . sets x^cXandt^c C22cfor^c2 0C22cfg if the supplier is uninformed then the rm sets xXunits and tpC22cper unit . In both instances the offers are accepted and the rm is able to sell xXunits . This approach provides the rm with the upside of minimizing the cost of the input it makes but is accompanied with the downside of paying information rents to the supplier with probability C22k . This arrangement results in expected rm payoff of C22kRC0C22c 1C0C22kRC0pC22cC138X . Comparing the rms payoffs under the above two approaches it follows that for the intermediate levels of R C22cpRC22cpC22k1C0pC22cthe rm prefers the former approachto keep the cost of input mhigh in order to lower its payment to the supplier for input b . In contrast for large Rvalues R.C22cpC22k1C0pC22cthe rm prefers the latter approach to not distort its make cost but instead bear a higher cost for the input it buys by offering the Slack contract . These outcomeslead directly to the following result . Appendix A provides proofs of all results with the proof of Proposition 1 providing a fulland formal characterization of the optimal contracts and the described equilibrium . Proposition 1 ForC22cpRC22cpC22k1C0p C22cthe rm reduces its investment in the new costcutting technology to limit the suppliers incentives to acquire information . In particular for these Rvalues kC22kC0RC0C22cpC138C22kIn Defense of Limited Manufacturing Cost Control Disciplining Acquisition of Private Information by Suppliers 33 The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022 Proposition 1 establishes that for intermediate Rvalues the rm underinvests in the new technology to credibly commit to Rationing when dealing with an informed supplier . In effect weakness tied to higher internal makecosts puts the rm in a position of strength when dealing with the external supplier . When Ris sufciently small voluntarily incurring higher make costs is unnecessary for the rmthe low revenues automatically make Rationing a credible outcome . When Ris sufciently large committing to Rationing is not worthwhile for the rm since it requires a substantial increase in makecosts.Consequently distortion in costcutting investment is conned to the intermediate interval of revenue values identied inProposition 1 . IV . ANALYSIS The binary setting in the previous section highlights the papers main theme when accounting for supplier incentives to acquire private information the rms costs to make and buy inputs interact in subtle fashion . In particular more expensive inhouse operations permit the rm to credibly commit to being stricter in trade terms when dealing with an informed supplier . Recognizing that its ensuing information rents will be limited the supplier is dissuaded from acquiring an information edge in the rst place . This section demonstrates that the same economic forces continue to apply and the results generalize in our modelwhich permits continuous supplier production cost c20C22cC138 and a continuum of information acquisition options k201C138 . We assume the functions vkandwkare appropriately welldened to ensure interior solutions for kandk . This is true for example for the familiar quadratic cost formulation vkz kk2andwkzkk2with appropriately large zcoefcients . The analysis is organized as follows . The rst subsection Benchmarks presents benchmark solutions corresponding to the case of a central planner making all decisions and the case wherein the supplierbuyer relationship is not subject to privateinformation . The equilibrium for the main model with information asymmetry between selfinterested buyer and supplier is derived via backward induction the second subsection The Firms Optimal Contract examines the rms optimal contract offer to the supplier for buying input b . In particular the contract species the quantity x^cand payment t^cas a function of the suppliers cost report ^c . The third subsection The Suppliers Acquisition of Private Information steps back to characterize k the suppliers information acquisition decision . The fourth subsection The Firms CostCutting Investment details the rms upfront costcutting investment in input mtaking into account the impact of the decision on the ensuing kx andtchoices . 2 Benchmarks In our model strategic interactions occur between a vertically separated buyer and supplier and the relationship is plagued with concerns for private information . In this subsection we present two pertinent benchmark results . The rst benchmarkdetails the outcome when all decisions are made by a central planner who owns and directs a vertically integrated supplier buyer entity . In effect in this case there are no concerns with divergent goals or distributed information . The second benchmark reverts to an independent and selfinterested buyer and supplier setting but in the absence of private information inthat any cost information learned by the supplier is also observed by the buyer . Consider the decisions of the central planner of an integrated entity . In this case given that the central planner controls both kandkhe chooses ksimply to maximize production efciency . Further he only acquires cost information if such information helps rene his production decision . Formally the central planners problem is as follows Max xC1kkkZC22c 0RC0C22kC0kC0cC138xcfcdc1C0kC138RC0C22kC0kC0EfcgC138xC0vkC0wk The above problem reects the fact that absent cost information an event that occurs with probability 1 C0k the central planner produces xunits at expected cost but when the planner obtains cost information he makes costcontingent production decisions xc . Lemma 1 presents the central planner benchmark by characterizing the solution to the above optimization problem . In denoting this solution we dene fksksgas the fkkgvalue that solves the following and then dene csasRC0C22kC0ks v0k XZC22c RC0C22kC0kcfcdcC01C0FRC0C22kC0kC138RC0C22kC0kC138where k1C0w0kX 1C0FRC0C22kC0k Lemma 1 With a central planner making decisions the equilibrium is as follows . 2The backward induction process identies the unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in our sequential game . As a corollary there is no subgame perfect mixed strategy equilibrium wherein the rm supplier randomizes its costcutting information acquisition investment.34 Arya Mittendorf and Ramanan The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022i For csC22c kkskksxX xcXifcC20csandxc0i fc.csand ii For csC21C22c kis the solution to w0kXk0xXandxcXfor all c. The central planner nds the cost information helpful when its production decisions are cost contingent . In particular when the downstream production cost cis below the threshold csproduction is protable and it is optimal to produce Xunits . When the same cost exceeds the said threshold it is optimal to not produce at all . This bangbang nature of production follows from linear cost and revenues . In part i the threshold value is interior csC22c and the production of Xunits corresponds to the planner opting for maximal production when the products unit contribution margin is nonnegative i.e . the condition cC20csis equivalent to RC0C22kC0ksC0cC210 . If the unit contribution margin is nonnegative for all cvalues then the cost information is valueless for the central planner since he opts for the production of Xunits in all circumstances . This is the case in part ii so the solution is the boundary point k0 . As a second intuitive benchmark we consider a vertically separated supplier and buyer so as to note the selfinterested suppliers incentives for information acquisition when he does not have an information edge . In this no private informationsetting the supplier does not acquire information for it derives no benet from itthe rm will only reimburse the supplier therealized cost when trade takes placebut the supplier alone bears the cost of acquiring information . Thus k0 . With both parties being uninformed the rm pays the supplier its expected cost to purchase Xunits i.e . xXandtEfcg . The rms costcutting initiative chooses investment in new technology to maximize RC0C22kC0kC0EfcgC138XC0wkyielding w 0kX . This no private information benchmark summarized in Lemma 2 is identical to the no information acquisition outcome in Lemma 1ii . Lemma 2 In the absence of private information the equilibrium is as follows the rms investment in the new cost cutting technology satises w0kXthe supplier acquires no information i.e . k0 and the rm offers the contract xXandtEfcg . The main distinction of the no private information solution in Lemma 2 relative to the central planner solution in Lemma 1 is in the suppliers information acquisition incentive . Since the supplier does not internalize the buyers benet from the information it never acquires information . Specically public information either leads to the supplier being reimbursed for production cost alone or to no transaction occurring . In effect the supplier is subject to a holdup problem receiving no ex post payments for acquiring information . In both the benchmarks presented a common thread is that the costcutting investment decision wkis chosen solely to maximize productive efciency . However as this paper will demonstrate in the presence of supplier private information thebuyer is more strategic and judicious in its investment choice . The Firms Optimal Contract Returning to our model for a given kandkwe rst detail the rms optimal contract offer to the supplier . Naturally when the supplier is uninformed the rm need not pay any information rents . Thus as in the binary case it is optimal for the rm tooffer to buy x C3Xunits at expected cost i.e . tC3Efcg . We use to denote the equilibrium outcomes . The supplier of course has no reason to decline this offer . If the supplier is privately informed the rms optimal offer is obtained by solving the problem presented in Program 1 below . To elaborate the rm offers a menu of contracts fx^ct^cg^c20C22cC138 to maximize its expected prot subject to the individual rationality constraints IR the incentive compatibility constraints IC and the capacity constraints CC where the constraints hold for all c and ^cvalues in 0C22cC138 . Program 1 Max xctcZC22c 0RC0C22kC0kC0tcC138xcfcdc subject to tcC0cC138xcC210 8c20C22cC138 IR tcC0cC138xcC21 t^cC0cC138x^c8 c^c20C22cC138 IC 0C20xcC20X 8c20C22cC138 CCIn Defense of Limited Manufacturing Cost Control Disciplining Acquisition of Private Information by Suppliers 35 The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022 Relegating the technical derivation of Program 1s solution to Appendix A we note the key process steps and the economics underlying the optimal contract . First the highestcost supplier earns no information rents i.e . the IR constraint forcC22cbinds . Second we establish that the incentive compatibility constraints IC can be replaced by their local counterparts tcC0cC138xcRC22c cxcdc . Notice that the righthand side of the local incentive compatibility constraints represents the ccost suppliers information rents . It follows that curtailing production for high cvalues can then be a tool to use for reducing the suppliers rents and the optimal contract indeed exhibits this feature . In particular given the linear cost and revenue functions the optimal contract for the informed supplier prescribes bang bang production the rm sets xC3^cXfor^cC20cC3andxC3^c0 otherwise . In terms of payment for cvalues below the cC3 hurdle value wherein production is prescribed the rm pays the supplier tC3^ccC3 . This ensures that the supplier has no incentives to misreport its cost for any crealization . Clearly under this hurdle contract the parties trade with probability FcC3 where cC3is the unique cvalue that solves Max cFcRC0C22kC0kC0cC138X 2 Proposition 2 presents the optimal contract and details how the cost of making one input is tied to the cost of buying the other input . Proposition 2 i When the supplier is uninformed the rms optimal contract is xC3XandtC3Efcg ii When the supplier is informed the rms optimal contract is xC3^cXand tC3^ccC3kfor ^c20cC3kC138 and xC3^c0 and t^c0 for ^c2cC3kC22cC138 where cC3kHcC3k RC0C22kC0kC138 and iii The more the rm invests to reduce the cost of the input it makes the higher is its payment to the informed supplier when it procures the input i.e.dcC3k dk1 1H0cC3k.0 . Part ii of Proposition 2 establishes that the rms offer to the informed supplier is conditional on the rms upfront investment in reducing the cost of the input it makes . That is while the rms cost of making input mis independent of the suppliers cost of making input bin light of private information the make and buy problems interact . Specically part iii of Proposition 2 shows that cC3kis an increasing function of the rms costcutting investment . Intuitively the higher the rms make cost the greater its need to control the buy cost to optimize its prot . The reason for this is that once there is a signicant internal cost of inputs the opportunity cost of failing to produce a nal good is smaller this smallopportunity cost of abandoning production translates into a small opportunity cost of limiting rents via rationing . Conversely higher upfront investment in the new technology i.e . lower marginal make costs results in the rm subsequently becoming more generous in setting supplier trade terms . This effect suggests a silver lining to a rm incurring higher make costs such a rmcredibly signals to its supplier that attempts to extract information rents from the rm will be met with added resistance . This signalin turn impacts the suppliers enthusiasm for acquiring private information in the rst place the issue we next address . The Suppliers Acquisition of Private Information Using backward induction and given the result in Proposition 2i and 2ii the supplier makes its information acquisition decision fully aware that if informed and cC20c C3ki tw i l ls u p p l yt h e r m Xunits of input batcC3kper unit . By expending vk the supplier is informed of cwith probability k. When informed and if cC20cC3k the supplier earns information rents of cC3kC0c per unit . In the other caseswhether the information system proves ineffective or reveals c.cC3kthe supplier earns no rents in the former case trade for Xunits occurs at expected cost and in the latter case trade does not occur . Thus the supplier chooses the precision of its information system to maximize its expected rents net of information acquisition cost by solving Max kkZcC3k 0cC3kC0cC138XfcdcC0vk 3 We denote the solution to 3 the suppliers optimal kvalue by kC3cC3k the next proposition presents this solution and details how it changes with investment in the new technology . Proposition 3 i The supplier chooses information system of precision kC3cC3k where kC3cC3kis the unique k value that satisesRcC3k 0Hcfcdcv0k X and36 Arya Mittendorf and Ramanan The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022ii The more the rm invests in the new technology the greater the precision of the suppliers information system i.e.dkC3cC3k dkXFcC3k v00kC31H0cC3k C138.0 . Proposition 3i prescribes the suppliers optimal kC3cC3k . Intuitively the more generous the impending procurement contract when informed the greater the potential information rents and thus the stronger the suppliers incentives to increase the precision of the information system . The dependence of kC3onkis due to the fact that the rms investment in the new technology impacts cC3k the rms offer to the informed supplier as noted in Proposition 2iii . The offer in turn inuences the suppliers expected information rents as noted in 3 and hence its desire to acquire information . Consistent with thislinkage and in line with intuition the higher the rms investment in new technology the more generous its contract terms and as a consequence the greater the suppliers desire to acquire information . The comparative statics in Proposition 3ii capture this relationship . To provide added intuition consider the familiar quadratic cost function vkz kk2 with cdrawn from the standard uniform distribution i.e . cU01C138 . In this case kC3XRC0C22kC0kC138216zk . It follows that kincreases monotonically with k as noted in part ii of the Propositionthe external supplier acquires private information more often as its buyer becomesmore efcient . Additionally as z kgoes down the suppliers kchoice increasesas private information becomes less expensive for the supplier to acquire it seeks to gain an information advantage more often . The analysis highlights the conicting dual roles of the rms upfront investment wk . On the one hand it lowers the rms cost of making its input . On the other hand it increases the likelihood of confronting an informationally advantaged supplier who will use that information to the detriment of the rm . In determining its optimal investment the rm balances both effects as shown next . The Firms CostCutting Investment Naturally the rm would like to dissuade the supplier from becoming privately informed . But as discussed thus far doing so is costly for the rmit has to bear a higher cost of making input mby making an inefcient investment in the new technology . Formally the rm chooses ki.e . invests wk to maximize its ex ante expected prot as follows Max kkC3cC3k C1FcC3kRC0C22kC0kC0cC3k C138 X1C0kC3cC3kC138RC0C22kC0kC0Efcg C138 XC0wk 4 The rst term in 4 is the rms expected payoff from trade with an informed supplier when trade occurs the rm pays the supplier cC3kfor each of the Xunits of input band incurs cost C22kC0kto make each of Xunits of input m. The second term in 4 is the rms expected payoff from trade with an uninformed supplier in this case trade occurs at expected cost for Xunits of input band the rm incurs cost C22kC0kto make each unit of input m. The last term is simply the cost of the rms upfront investment in the new technology . In order to better understand the role of the rms costcutting initiative in 4 on the suppliers incentive to acquire information we initially derive the rms optimal investment absent such incentive . To this end assume the supplier is informed of cwith an exogenous probability ^ki.e.kis not a choice variable for the supplier but is assumed xed . In this case let ^k^kdenote the rms optimal reduction in cost . Formally stated ^k^kis the solution to the problem in 4 wherein kC3cC3kis simply replaced by ^k . Using the envelope theorem to account for the dependency of cC3konk^k^kis the unique kvalue that satises the following rstorder condition ^kC1FcC3k 1C0^kC138no Xw0k 5 The solution in 5 is intuitive . At one extreme suppose the supplier was always uninformed . In this case the rm would procure Xunits of input batEfcgand thus select its upfront investment to maximize RC0C22kC0kEfcgC138XC0wk . This yields the rstorder condition Xw0kin the uninformed supplier setting and as in Lemma 2 for the no private information benchmark case . At the other extreme suppose the supplier is always informed . In this case the rm procures Xunits of input b atcC3kwith probability FcC3kand thus select its investment to maximize FcC3kRC0fC22kC0kcC3kgC138XC0wk . Using dcC3kdkfrom Proposition 2iii the rstorder condition for this problem simplies to FcC3kXw0kSince the rm contracts with an uninformed informed supplier with probability 1 C0^k^k the probabilityweighted rstorder conditions yield 5 . Another way of viewing this is in relation to the central planner benchmark of Lemma 1 which species ksC1FRC0C22kC0ks 1C0ksC138C8C9 Xw0ks . That is for a given kthe rms costcutting choice replicates the central planners other than the reduction of investment brought by the rationing in production due to information rents in the rst term i.e . cC3kRC0C22kC0k . Notice that the rms costcutting investment is lowered due to the adverse selection problem compared to the benchmark solution in Lemma 2 . This is reected by the fact that the probability of trade in the lefthand side of 5 is 1when dealingIn Defense of Limited Manufacturing Cost Control Disciplining Acquisition of Private Information by Suppliers 37 The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022 with an uninformed supplier but FcC3^k1when dealing with an informed supplier . Recall that 5 is derived for an exogenously chosen ^k . Endogenizing the suppliers information acquisition results in an added marginal cost to the rms investment . In particular the marginal cost to the rm of increasing investment is not just w0k but also the cost associated with the increased likelihood of confronting an informed supplier . After all a greater reduction in input ms cost conveys a greater willingness of the rm to pay for input bboosting the suppliers desire to acquire information . The next proposition formalizes this result . Proposition 4 i The rms investment in the new technology is wkC3 where kC3is the unique kvalue that satises kC3cC3k C1FcC3k 1C0kC3cC3kC138 fg X w0kZcC3k 0HcXfcdcZC22c cC3kRC0C22kC0kC0cC138Xfcdc dkC3cC3k dkand ii The rm underinvests in the new technology to limit the suppliers incentives to acquire information i.e.kC3^kkC3 . Formally Proposition 4i presents the equilibrium investment undertaken by the rm . Compared to 5 the added positive term on the righthand side of the equation captures the marginal impact of the rms kchoice on the suppliers information acquisition and the ensuing adverse selection problem . Specically when trading with an uninformed supplier the rm earnsRC22c 0RC0C22kC0kC3C0cC138Xfcdcin prot . Relative to this rst best prot level with an informed supplier the rm loses on two counts a for cC20cC3ktrade occurs but the rm pays information rents ofRcC3k 0HcXfcdcand b for c.cC3kthe rm forgoes protable trade worthRC22c cC3kRC0C22kC0kC3C0cC138Xfcdc . The sum of the terms in a and b represents the total cost borne by the rm when an otherwise uninformed supplier acquires information and becomes informed . The increased likelihood of the supplier becoming informed due to a marginal decrease in the rms makecost is dkC3cC3kdka positive term from Proposition 3ii . Thus the product of dkC3cC3kdkwith the sum of losses in a and b captures the expected marginal cost of the rm due to supplier information acquisition tied to the rms costcutting investment . Notice that this is precisely the term that is added to the righthand side in Proposition 4i relative to the rst order condition in 5 . In summary compared to the benchmark investment in the absence of private information noted in Lemma 2 the rms equilibrium investment level is lowered on two counts . First because of the adverse selection problem due to contracting withan informed supplier the rm drops the investment down to w^k . Second the likelihood of contracting with an informed supplier is itself endogenous in the model since it is tied to the suppliers choice of the precision of the information system . In response to the suppliers information acquisition incentives the rm further drops its investment so wk C3w^k . Proposition 4ii conrms this intuition . Taken together Propositions 2 3 and 4 also capture the frictions that arise relative to the central planner benchmark in Lemma 1 the rm engages in socially costly production rationing to counter the adverse selection problem with its self interested supplier . The supplier in turn acquires information to maximize information rents rather than to promote production efciency as was the case with the central planner this too results in socially suboptimal information acquisition . To dissuade such exploitationdriven learning the rm in turn introduces cost inefciencies . If these collective deviations cause substantial societal losses one might expect regulatory i.e . central planner arrangements that prevent these frictions from arising in therst place . As an example while allowing outsiders access to rms internal data is often fraught with risk for an organization mandatory audits of supplier cost and regulated costplus pricing common practices in government contracts can both reduce frictions and ensure that gains ensue to both supply chain participants . Further our analysis in this setting provides impetus forregulators to more favorably view vertical integration recognizing that the reduction in friction can offset the disadvantages due to reducing access of other buyers to the suppliers products . Elaborate contracts governing investments in information acquisition and transparency of acquired information coupled with revenue sharing can also serve as de facto means of approaching the integrated solution . Although the setting does not provide a determinative answer as to when regulatory intervention or lack thereof is necessary identifying the relevant inefcienciesboth investment and productiondriven byinformation concerns can help identify circumstances most ripe for intervention . V. TRADING WITH A MAYBE INFORMED SUPPLIER In the analysis thus far it was assumed that when the rm offered a contract to the supplier it knew whether the supplier was informed although the information itself was privately known only to the supplier . This led to a familiar characterization38 Arya Mittendorf and Ramanan The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022of the optimal contract since the arrangement simply reected standard adverse selection concerns . As a consequence the analysis was able to focus on the novel economic force how the rms upfront investment in the new technology conveys itswillingness to pay for an outsourced input and the ensuing incentives for the suppliers private information acquisition . Thissubsection demonstrates that the results continue to apply in a framework where the information problem is more severe in thatthe rm confronts a maybe informed supplier . To succinctly examine the role of the rms investment in this environment we revert back to the binary setting in Section III with one change when kC22kat the time of offering the contract the rm does not know whether it is dealing with an uninformed or an informed supplier let alone the cost information the supplier maypossess . In effect the rms observation is limited only to knowing whether the supplier installs the information system kC22k or does not install the system k0 . Analogous to Proposition 1 the next proposition notes that the rm again limits its costcutting investment in order to inuence the suppliers acquisition of private information . Proposition 5 The rm reduces its investment in the new technology to limit the suppliers incentives to acquire information it makes if i C22kC20k yandRyRRyC22cC22k21C0pC138p2 1C0C22kC1381C0C22kpC138o r ii C22k.kyandRyRRyC22c1C0pC138 where ky1pC0 1C0p24p2p 2p1C0pandRyMinC22cp1C0C22kpC138 1C0C22kC22c 1C0C22k1C0pC138no . In particular for these parameter values kC22kC0RC0RyC138C22k . Proposition 5 identies two cases of intermediate Rvalues wherein the rm underinvests i.e . chooses kC22kdespite the fact that the investment in the new technology is essentially costless . To formally derive the parameters for these cases notethat if the supplier does not invest in the information system i.e . chooses k0 the rm buys xXunits from the supplier at tpC22cper unit and the rms payoff is RC0C22kC0kC0pC22cC138X . If the supplier invests in the information system i.e . chooses kC22k the rm has three options to deal with the maybe informed supplier i Rationing Under this contract x^c0X t^c00x^cC22cor^c0 and t^cC22cor^c0 . Under Rationing trade occurs with probability C22k1C0pC138 i.e . if the supplier is informed and c0 . The rms payoff under Rationing is C22k1C0pC138RC0C22kC0kC138X . ii Partial Rationing Under this contract x^c0o r ^cX t^c0o r ^cpC22c x^cC22c0 and t^cC22c0 . Under Partial Rationing trade occurs with probability C22k1C0pC1381C0C22k i.e . either if the supplier is informed and c0 or if the supplier is uninformed . The rms payoff under Partial Rationing is C22k1C0p1C0C22kC138RC0C22kC0kC0pC22cC138X . iii Slack Under this contract x^cXandt^c C22cfor all cost reports ^c0C22c . Under Slack trade always occurs since the contract attracts both the uninformed and the informed supplier . The rms payoff under Slack isRC0C22kC0kC0C22cC138X . Comparing the prot expressions in i through iii the rm offers a Rationing contract to a supplier that has invested in the information system if and only if C22kC0kC21RC0MinC22cp1C0C22kpC138 1C0C22kC22c 1C0C22k1C0pC138C26C27 6 The lower bound on Rin Proposition 5 implies that for low Rvalues i.e . RC20Ry condition 6 is satised even if the rm chooses the maximum investment wC22k . That is for these Rvalues the rm can afford to make the maximum investment in the new technology for it will still lead to the Rationing contract should the supplier choose to invest in the informationsystem . Thus for these Rvalues the rms investment is wC22k the supplier does not install the information system the rm seeks xXunits offering tpC22cper unit and trade always occurs . ForR.R y6 is not satised for the choice of kC22k . Thus for these Rvalues the rm either has to distort its investment so that kC22kC0RC0RyC138C22kand 6 is satised as an equality or deal with a supplier who installs the information system . The upper bound on Rin Proposition 5i is the Rvalue at which the rm is indifferent between a making the distorted investment decision such that kC22kC0RC0C22cp1C0C22kpC138 1C0C22kC16C17 permitting commitment to the Rationing contract if kC22kand b making the undistorted investment decision wC22kand offering the Partial Rationing contract to the supplier who chooses kC22k . In akin fashion the upper bound on Rin Proposition 5ii is the Rvalue at which the rm is indifferent between a making the distorted investment decision such that kC22kC0RC0C22c 1C0C22k1C0pC138C16C17 permitting commitment to the Rationing contract if kC22kand b making the undistorted investment decision wC22k and offering a Slack contract to the supplier who chooses kC22kIn Defense of Limited Manufacturing Cost Control Disciplining Acquisition of Private Information by Suppliers 39 The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022 Thekycutoff is the C22kvalue at which the rm is indifferent between offering the Partial Rationing and the Slack contracts to a supplier who has chosen kC22kwhen Ris at the upper bound value in part i . At this Rvalue for C22kC20kythe rm prefers Partial Rationing to Slack since giving up trade for the case cC22cis acceptable if the event occurs with a small probability C22kp . Intuitively for the rm to distort its upfront investment decision Rmust be large enough that it is not credible for the rm to commit to curtailing the suppliers information rents at the offer stage without the distortion . At the same time Rmust be small enough that the required distortion is not so severe that it overwhelms the benet obtained from dissuading the supplier from acquiring information . In effect the nature of the resultthat the rm optimally distorts its make decision to curtail supplier information rentsis exactly the same as in the rest of the paper the key difference in the maybe informed supplier setting is that it entails added algebraic computations to characterize the optimal contract needed to resolve the more severeinformation differential between the rm and the supplier . VI . IMPLICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL INTERPRETATIONS The primary result herein is couched in terms of limiting investment in costreducing technology . The main force is that a rm would willingly and publicly sidestep such investment so that it can credibly convey a willingness to ration purchasesfrom a supplier . This signal to the supplier in turn convinces it not to invest in gaining an informational advantage as rentsbecome less likely to ensue . Despite this focus on costs an equally potent investment reduction would be on efforts to boost product demand such as advertising product improvements market expansion or research and development . In these cases it is the marginal revenue that is sacriced rather than marginal cost efciencies but the resulting lower margin will have a similareffect of dissuading supplier information acquisition . Although this primary result is shown in a streamlined model the key features point to when these considerations would prevail in practice 1 a decision to willingly cut into prot margins in order to 2 address an inefciency in the provision ofinputs when 3 an input provider may gain private information to its own advantage . These features suggest some relevant empirical implications . In particular all else equal we would expect to see rm investments to be lower when they a rely more heavily on outside supply for inputs b procure inputs in markets subject to inefciencies and c face potentialinformation asymmetries upstream . These predicted determinants of rm investment levels can arise empirically as payments toprimary suppliers representing a larger share of annual expenses e.g . Chod Lyandres and Yang 2019 Chen Di Jiang and Li 2020 the suppliers having a vested interest in the specic customer relationship in the form of high customer concentration e.g . Patatoukas 2012 Hui Liang and Yeung 2019 and the relationships between those suppliers and rms being in early stages when potential information asymmetry is most pronounced e.g . Irvine Park and Yildizhan 2016 . The results also point to a more nuanced explanation for the empirical connections between buyersupplier relationships and buyer operating costs . A prevailing theme in empirical examinations of buyersupplier relationships is that thosecharacterized by more cooperative more selfinterested behavior exhibit lower higher internal operating costs at the buyerlevel see e.g . Dahlstrom and Nygaard [ 1999 ] andCannon and Homburg [ 2001 ] for early work in this arena . The natural inference drawn from this phenomenon is that cooperative suppliers can add value by helping lower buyers costs even beyond the costs of the suppliers inputs . This paper presents a different interpretationit is not that less cooperative suppliersundermine buyer operating costs it is that buyers have reasons themselves to retain higher operating costs when dealing with selfinterested suppliers . Future empirical work in this area thus could examine the extent to which information asymmetry is a determinant of the empirical relation between buyersupplier interactions and buyer costs . These specic implications for measures of rm investment notwithstanding a willing decision to reduce unit margins is not limited to a decision not to invest suggesting other implications . For example many rms have been documented as willingly taking on socially responsible choices at the expense of rising marginal production costs . While this is typicallyviewed as a means of boosting product demand or as a defensive mechanism to dissuade regulation see e.g . Baron 2001 Bagnoli and Watts 2003 Orlitzky Siegel and Waldman 2011 our results suggest that upstream consequences also may play a role . In a similar vein a rm may also willingly embed new costs as part of its sales strategy via a visible charitable act . The buyonegiveone model popularized by TOMS and later adopted by Warby Parker Bombas and others is a prime example.These costly efforts are usually viewed through the lens of raising brand loyalty the results here suggest an upstreamconsequence in addition to the downstream one . In terms of interpretations of the upstream relationship we implicitly cast the provision of inputs as for tangible goods . The unique input provided by the supplier need not be a tangible product for the underlying forces to apply . For examplenegotiations with potential labor providers also have the feature that weaker rm prospects can inuence bargaining position e.g . Bova 2013 . Yet there is varied evidence of the relationship between rm investment and union presence see e.g . Machin and Wadhwani 1991 Odgers and Betts 1997 Y. Chen and I. Chen 2013 . The present analysis suggests that the relationship between investment levels and labor unions may also depend on the extent to which information asymmetry or the potential for it is a key piece of the negotiation . If the labor force in question can gain a leg up by gaining information or40 Arya Mittendorf and Ramanan The Accounting Review Volume 97 Number 1 2022expertise that can boost negotiating leverage then the rms best response may be a reduction in investment as a signal that such leverage will not come to fruition . Despite these potential applications it should be stressed that there are circumstances in which the forces surely do not apply . Most importantly for our result to hold it must be that the seemingly inefcient investment reduces perunit marginsand is not simply a case of burning money . That is if the rm cuts investments in a way that reduced its overall bottom line without affecting the incremental benets of additional production such weakness would be counterproductive because it does not alter the rms penchant for informationbased rationing and thereby does not curb potential rents from supplier informationacquisition . Similarly limiting margins with costcutting investments can serve a productive role in cutting information rentsonly if it is seen as a credible signal by the supplier . If such investments are not externally observable in a timely fashion e.g . negotiated contracts with executives that shift compensation terms or can readily be reversed e.g . just intentions to make charitable contributions then they can not serve the key role that limiting costcutting investments play here . Some rm actions and decisions are naturally publicly observable such as the adoption of a new technology considered in this paper . In other cases public observability may require voluntary disclosures by the rm . Incorporating voluntarydisclosures in our modelunder the typical presumption that such disclosures are subject to audit and must be truthfulwouldyield full disclosure in our setting e.g . Grossman 1981 Milgrom 1981 leaving the analysis unchanged . However when disclosures are observed by multiple audiences not just the supplier the analysis is admittedly not so straightforward . For example conveying high unit conversion costs to upstream suppliers rubs against the rms incentives to disclose strength todeter downstream competitors or to meet capital market expectations . While beyond the scope of this paper studying such offsetting tensions and their consequences for the rms investment is an interesting problem for future work . VII . CONCLUSION Manufacturing processes in rms often entail inhouse production of some inputs and reliance on outsourcing for other inputs . This paper examines investment and information issues that arise naturally in such situations . In particular the rm is concerned with initiatives it can undertake to curtail the cost of the input it makes as well as with contract terms it can offer to reduce payment for the input it buys . The rms decisions are inextricably tied to the suppliers decision to acquire privateinformation that allows it to potentially earn information rents for the input it sells to the rm . The paper derives the equilibriumthat reveals an interaction between the rms seemingly independent make and buy costs a higher make cost for the rm serves to dampen the suppliers aggressiveness in information acquisition and reduces the rms buy cost . To elaborate if the rms inhouse operations become more expensive on a perunit basis then the rm can credibly commit to being less generous in its trade terms with the supplier . Formally when confronting a privately informed supplier the rm balances production and rents by forgoing trade i.e . engaging in rationing on some occasions in order to reduce what it pays when trade does occur . The higher makecost of the rm shifts this tradeoff in favor of rationing further limitingthe suppliers information rents . As a corollary the supplier has weakened incentives to acquire private information resulting in the rm and the supplier being on a more level information footing when negotiating trade terms . To focus on this novel makeandbuy interaction we establish the key result in a linear technology setting and one wherein the rm knows whether itssupplier is informed but not what the informed supplier knows . Subsequently we also demonstrate that the interaction persists in the maybe informed supplier case wherein the information problem is more severe in that the rm does not even know whether its supplier is informed . Broadly stated our analysis demonstrates that the rms decision to procure from an external party has implications for internal efciency for the rm . While the internal implications in this paper pertain to the rms make decision it is certainlynot the only critical internal decision that can be so impacted . Future work may wish to study the implications of suppliersprivate information acquisition on other aspects of a rms accounting system including its corporate governance mechanisms and internal control systems .'"
