I want to define the project as building a model that can classify the political leanings of tax bills for different state legislative sessions. It iwll take some time, but I would like to gather transcripts for state legislative sessions, reduce them to time given to discussion of tax specific bills. Collection of this data is certainly worthwile, but may be too cumbersome to collect for this class. One alternative for training a similar model would be to do the same classification but with reddit posts. I could select five left leaning subreddits and five right leaning subreddits and train a model to classify/predict whether a certain post came from a left or right leaning subreddits. There may not be enough data to do this exclusively with tax related posts, but I think this is a good place to start. "
