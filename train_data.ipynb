Times)</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami, this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate. For our viewers in the United States and around the world, welcome to Miami Florida, I\\'m Jake Tapper.</p>\\n<p>In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically.</p>\\n<p>Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins. They\\'re a winner-take-all state. So that\\'s the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting.</p>\\n<p>We hope tonight the candidates will give the voters specifics on their visions for America.</p>\\n<p>So now let\\'s welcome the candidates.</p>\\n<p>Ohio Governor John Kasich. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Real estate developer and businessman Donald Trump. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates for president of the United States. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Before we begin this evening, we want to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan, who passed away this week. Her funeral will be held tomorrow and we would like to take a moment of silence to remember Nancy Reagan.</p>\\n<p>[<em>moment of silence</em>]</p>\\n<p>Now, please rise for our national anthem performed by the Frost Singers from the University of Miami.</p>\\n<p>[<em>the national anthem is performed</em>] [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Thanks to the Frost Singers from the University of Miami.</p>\\n<p>Candidates, you can now take your positions behind the podiums while I briefly explain the rules. As moderator, I will attempt to guide the discussion, asking questions and followups. Joining me in the questioning this evening will be Washington Times reporter Stephen Dinan, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, and Salem Radio\\'s Hugh Hewitt.</p>\\n<p>Candidates, you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question, and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked. That\\'s longer than you\\'ve had in previous debates.</p>\\n<p>Timing lights will be visible. Those lights will warn you when time is up. And as you requested, a bell will also sound, like this.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>We know that each of you wants to debate these important issues, but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another. These are the rules to which all of you agreed.</p>\\n<p>Our goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s time now for opening statements. You\\'ll each have 30 seconds.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kasich, we will start with you.</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.</p>\\n<p>And I believe it\\'s a new partnership — a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we\\'ve ever had.</p>\\n<p>Thank you. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Rubio?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what\\'s at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What\\'s at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.</p>\\n<p>For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Cruz?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.</p>\\n<p>This election, this debate is not about insults. It\\'s not about attacks. It\\'s not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It\\'s about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Mr. Trump?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they\\'re voting. They\\'re voting out of enthusiasm. They\\'re voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before — 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old — never voted before.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re taking people from the Democrat Party. We\\'re taking people as independents, and they\\'re all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It\\'s very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we\\'re going to beat them soundly. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in — on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump\\'s, the front runner\\'s, signature issues is ending what he calls \"disastrous trade deals\" in order to bring jobs back to America.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kasich, I\\'d like to start with you. You\\'ve been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America\\'s bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you\\'ve been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we\\'re sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.</p>\\n<p>But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I\\'ve been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don\\'t turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, \"Oh, America was right,\" and people are out of work.</p>\\n<p>The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.</p>\\n<p>But we don\\'t want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don\\'t want to see that happen.</p>\\n<p>Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they\\'re a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.</p>\\n<p>And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you\\'ve brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.</p>\\n<p>Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I\\'m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We\\'re allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries — the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it\\'s very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.</p>\\n<p>So I will take advantage of it; they\\'re the laws. But I\\'m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you\\'re, quote, \"generally very much in favor of free trade.\" More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We\\'re 5 percent of the world\\'s population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.</p>\\n<p>The problem is we\\'re a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can\\'t export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.</p>\\n<p>There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It\\'s allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it\\'s created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, you\\'ve seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don\\'t like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Actually that\\'s incorrect. There are two different agreements. There\\'s TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we\\'re getting killed in international trade right now. And we\\'re getting killed because we have an administration that\\'s doesn\\'t look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We\\'re driving jobs overseas.</p>\\n<p>And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I\\'ll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.</p>\\n<p>And you\\'ve got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what\\'s the solution? It\\'s easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things.</p>\\n<p>Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I\\'ve introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Let\\'s talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let\\'s go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn\\'t this program take jobs away from Americans?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> If it\\'s being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you\\'re not replacing Americans, but that you\\'ve tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.</p>\\n<p>The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don\\'t understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire — Disney or some other company hires this company.</p>\\n<p>What they\\'re basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they\\'re employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.</p>\\n<p>It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>You\\'ve — in the — in the context of illegal immigration, you\\'ve called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Correct.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you\\'ve talked about are solved.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well first, I think — well, I\\'d be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don\\'t think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.</p>\\n<p>If there\\'s an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that\\'s in violation of the law. And what I\\'m explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not — what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.</p>\\n<p>They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn\\'t replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they\\'re hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It\\'s a loophole they\\'ve figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, \"lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers\". He\\'s calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn\\'t that help workers in the U.S.?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn\\'t be standing here. I\\'d be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn\\'t have immigration.</p>\\n<p>Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can\\'t have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we — I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.</p>\\n<p>I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can\\'t continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.</p>\\n<p>And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they\\'ve been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.</p>\\n<p>But let\\'s not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.</p>\\n<p>We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we\\'ll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I\\'ve used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I\\'ve been governor</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it\\'s something that I frankly use and I shouldn\\'t be allowed to use it. We shouldn\\'t have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it\\'s very important to say, well, I\\'m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do.</p>\\n<p>When it\\'s sitting there waiting for you, but it\\'s very bad. It\\'s very bad for business in terms of — and it\\'s very bad for our workers and it\\'s unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.</p>\\n<p>And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he\\'s the only one that\\'s going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what\\'s going on.</p>\\n<p>We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we\\'re rushing into things, and we\\'re just — we\\'re leading with the chin.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>We\\'re leading with people that don\\'t know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I\\'d say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we\\'re bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn\\'t working. And then on top of that, we\\'ve got a system that\\'s allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.</p>\\n<p>And the answer to that, I\\'ve laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We\\'re going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We\\'re going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we\\'re going to do that.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>We\\'re going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It\\'s not that we don\\'t know how to do it. It\\'s that we\\'re lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.</p>\\n<p>The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.</p>\\n<p>We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren\\'t actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system.</p>\\n<p>The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don\\'t have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I\\'m grateful every day that America welcomed them.</p>\\n<p>But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don\\'t have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, you\\'ve called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Education through Washington, D.C. I don\\'t want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.</p>\\n<p>And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is... [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well.</p>\\n<p>So there are a lot of things. But I\\'m going to have Ben very involved with education, something that\\'s an expertise of his.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say \"education by Washington, D.C.,\" what do you mean?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> You\\'re right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what\\'s happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.</p>\\n<p>Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, look, all I\\'m in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I\\'ve been working on this for many, many years.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.</p>\\n<p>Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.</p>\\n<p>Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.</p>\\n<p>We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.</p>\\n<p>Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.</p>\\n<p>So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That\\'s what it is in the state of Ohio. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it\\'s local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What\\'s wrong with that?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it\\'s easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.</p>\\n<p>Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.</p>\\n<p>And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child — African American, Hispanic — every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Let\\'s move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they\\'re very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.</p>\\n<p>Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, first of all, let me say that you\\'re right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I\\'m against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don\\'t have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, \"We don\\'t have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,\" they\\'re not being honest with you.</p>\\n<p>Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.</p>\\n<p>For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I\\'m supposed to retire, I\\'d have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I\\'d be one of the youngest people there. [<em>laughter</em>]</p>\\n<p>If I\\'ve made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now.</p>\\n<p>These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t answer that part. So the thing is that my — my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.</p>\\n<p>But again I\\'m talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We\\'re years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don\\'t have to change it at all. If we don\\'t do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It\\'s not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s — all of it will be eaten up by that. That\\'s a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Mr. Trump, you don\\'t want to raise the retirement age, and you also don\\'t want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I\\'ve watched them very intensely, even though it\\'s a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They\\'re leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more.</p>\\n<p>And that\\'s what we\\'re up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we\\'re up against.</p>\\n<p>I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.</p>\\n<p>And it\\'s my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is.</p>\\n<p>You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It\\'s not long in terms of what we\\'re talking about, but it\\'s still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...</p>\\n<p>I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody\\'s ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it\\'s a — it\\'s a national tragedy. We\\'re at zero, we\\'re not doing anything.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve lost our jobs. We\\'ve lost everything. We\\'re losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We\\'re going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You\\'re talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you\\'re talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Because they don\\'t cover most of the subjects. We\\'re the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We\\'re going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take — every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing.</p>\\n<p>We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We\\'re going to negotiate real deals now, and we\\'re going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We\\'re going to bring wealth back to our country. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> No. And I — and I think you\\'ve outlined why. The numbers don\\'t add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we\\'re going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that\\'s the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can\\'t talk about that, but people know that it\\'s the truth here in Florida.</p>\\n<p>Fraud is not enough. Certainly, let\\'s wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won\\'t add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I\\'m against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it\\'s less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don\\'t add up.</p>\\n<p>The bottom line is we can\\'t just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I\\'m going to get at fraud and abuse. Let\\'s get rid of fraud, let\\'s get rid of abuse, let\\'s be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you\\'re going to have to make up.</p>\\n<p>And here\\'s the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It\\'s barely been asked in any of these debates. And we\\'d better deal with or we\\'re going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don\\'t add up. What\\'s your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don\\'t add up. What\\'s your response, Mr. Trump?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, I don\\'t know if he\\'s saying that. Look, I\\'m just saying very simply we have a country that I\\'ve never seen anything like it. I\\'ve been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don\\'t bid things out. We don\\'t bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don\\'t go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That\\'s what they\\'re paying.</p>\\n<p>And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don\\'t bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it\\'s not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don\\'t want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK?</p>\\n<p>I\\'m self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don\\'t want anybody\\'s money. I will tell you something. We\\'re going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We\\'re going to save a fortune. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it\\'s irresponsible. And any politician that doesn\\'t step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we\\'ve got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can\\'t just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she\\'ll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn\\'t understand government is the problem. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Here\\'s my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in...[<em>bell rings</em>]...Washington right now who are killing jobs and I\\'ll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there\\'s a reason, in my campaign I\\'ve laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I\\'ve specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don\\'t do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let\\'s talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can\\'t take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn\\'t do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>If we\\'re going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you\\'ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I\\'ll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Thank you Senator Cruz.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, would you like to respond?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and — at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Cruz?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It\\'s easy to have language, I\\'m fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it\\'s very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.</p>\\n<p>When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>When I led the fight against amnesty, it\\'s because I was standing with the people...[<em>bell rings</em>]...against Washington. And if you want to tell people you\\'re going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington?</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> OK. Mr. Trump, I\\'ll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I\\'m going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, that\\'s fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there\\'s no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there\\'s nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.</p>\\n<p>And there\\'s nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We\\'re all in this together. We\\'re going to come up with solutions. We\\'re going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it\\'s been up here. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Governor Kasich, let\\'s get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, \"Get over cuts to Social Security benefits\" because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.</p>\\n<p>I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.</p>\\n<p>I have a plan to fix it that doesn\\'t even require raising the retirement age.</p>\\n<p>If you\\'ve had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you\\'ll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they\\'ll get their full benefit. That\\'s the way it will work. And we don\\'t have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I\\'ve done all this before.</p>\\n<p>This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn\\'t mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century.</p>\\n<p>So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we\\'re $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We\\'re up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again.</p>\\n<p>And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.</p>\\n<p>How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, first of all, I don\\'t really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it\\'s, again, the biggest story.</p>\\n<p>You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that\\'s trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.</p>\\n<p>You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that\\'s that.</p>\\n<p>But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don\\'t do it because we don\\'t play the game. and the only way we\\'re going to be able to do it is we\\'re going to have to do taxes unless they behave.</p>\\n<p>If you don\\'t tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we\\'re going to continue to lose businesses and we\\'re going to continue to lose jobs.</p>\\n<p>And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that\\'s why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I\\'m saying.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz...[<em>applause</em>]...Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He\\'s right about the problems. But his solutions don\\'t work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.</p>\\n<p>Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don\\'t know where he\\'ll be tonight. But I\\'ll tell you what happens. You know, we\\'ve seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.</p>\\n<p>And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.</p>\\n<p>A much better solution that works is the tax plan I\\'ve laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that\\'s what\\'s missing from what Donald says. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Mr. Trump, we\\'ll give you a chance to respond.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don\\'t behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can\\'t. China won\\'t let them. We talk about free trade. It\\'s not tree free trade, it\\'s stupid trade.</p>\\n<p>China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews, no anything. We can\\'t get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can\\'t get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.</p>\\n<p>The 45 percent is a threat that if they don\\'t behave, if they don\\'t follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn\\'t have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Cruz?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It\\'s not China that pays the tax. It\\'s you, the working men and women.</p>\\n<p>So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can\\'t pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, \"I\\'m going to jack — I\\'m going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.\" That hurts you.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s why we\\'ve got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> OK.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Jake, I have to say — honestly, it\\'s just the opposite. What will happen if they don\\'t behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we\\'ll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we\\'re being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.</p>\\n<p>So we\\'ll build our factories here and we\\'ll make our own products. And that\\'s the way it should be done. And the way we\\'ve been doing it for the last long period of time is our country — our country is in serious, serious trouble. It\\'s a bubble and it\\'s going to explode, believe me.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> All right. We\\'re going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we\\'ll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>[<em>commercial break</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, let me start with you. Last night, you told CNN quote, \"Islam hates us?\" Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Do you want to clarify the comment at all?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, you know, I\\'ve been watching the debate today. And they\\'re talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There\\'s something going on that maybe you don\\'t know about, maybe a lot of other people don\\'t know about, but there\\'s tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump\\'s comment last night, I\\'m sorry — Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can\\'t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It\\'s a very tough place to be a missionary. It\\'s Muslim.</p>\\n<p>And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn\\'t like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There\\'s no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.</p>\\n<p>I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you\\'re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you\\'re going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Mr. Trump? [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Marco talks about consequences. Well, we\\'ve had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems.</p>\\n<p>Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don\\'t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn\\'t that wonderful.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Mr. Trump, thank you.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> We better solve the problem before it\\'s too late.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Senator Rubio? [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, here we go. See, I\\'m not interested in being politically correct. I\\'m not interested in being politically correct. I\\'m interested in being correct. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And in order to be correct on this issue, here\\'s the bottom line. We do work. There is — Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.</p>\\n<p>There is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other — with Muslims, who do not — who are not radicals. We\\'re going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re going to have to work with the Saudis. We\\'re going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We\\'re going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.</p>\\n<p>And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Senator. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> No, I don\\'t. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn\\'t any question. And that\\'s why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don\\'t have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.</p>\\n<p>But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we\\'re going to defeat ISIS, we\\'re going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states.</p>\\n<p>And we\\'re going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just — they can\\'t believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.</p>\\n<p>Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we\\'re about and other Muslims who don\\'t share their view. But at the end of the day, we\\'ve got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Governor Kasich.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you\\'ve said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, \"take out\" the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, \"So they can kill us, but we can\\'t kill them?\"</p>\\n<p>It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting \"death to the USA.\" Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me.</p>\\n<p>As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law — this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn\\'t allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we\\'re working on a different set of parameters.</p>\\n<p>Now, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.</p>\\n<p>We better expand our laws or we\\'re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> No, of course not. And we don\\'t have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It\\'s difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I\\'m president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They\\'re going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.</p>\\n<p>And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because — because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He\\'s going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we\\'ve ever had.</p>\\n<p>We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they\\'re not going to have the right to remain silent. And they\\'re not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They\\'re going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we\\'ll do so legally. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Cruz, you\\'ve talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> No, of course not. We\\'ve never targeted innocent civilians and we\\'re not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we\\'ve faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening.</p>\\n<p>But the answer is not simply to yell, \"China bad, Muslims bad.\" You\\'ve got to understand the nature of the threats we\\'re facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.</p>\\n<p>And I\\'ll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that\\'s a mistake.</p>\\n<p>The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I\\'ll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>\\n<p>As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don\\'t think we need a commander in chief...[<em>bell rings</em>]...who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you Senator Cruz.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump. we\\'re going to come to you in a second, but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, \"sort of a neutral guy\". He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student.</p>\\n<p>He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> First of all, there\\'s nobody on this stage that\\'s more pro Israel than I am. OK. There\\'s nobody. [<em>applause</em>] I am pro-Israel. [<em>booing</em>]</p>\\n<p>I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I\\'ve made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of — I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>But I will tell you, I think if we\\'re going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I\\'ve spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is — I\\'m a negotiator. If I go in, I\\'ll say I\\'m pro-Israel and I\\'ve told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.</p>\\n<p>But I would like to at least have the other side think I\\'m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it\\'s probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Senator Trump...[<em>crosstalk</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it\\'s maybe the world deal I\\'ve ever seen. I think it\\'s the worst deal I\\'ve ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they\\'ve ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio.</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they\\'re our strongest ally in the region.</p>\\n<p>We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization.</p>\\n<p>They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad.</p>\\n<p>Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical...[<em>bell rings</em>]...Islamic terrorist.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Senator Rubio.</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> He\\'s hunting them down and stomping them.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> I want to go back to the Israeli government\\'s assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, that\\'s undeniable. First of all, they\\'ve said, they\\'ve encouraged people to do so. And you\\'ve seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they\\'re doing these sorts of things.</p>\\n<p>But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don\\'t know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that\\'s not your intent but here\\'s why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn\\'t. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Because there\\'s no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that\\'s what will happen again.</p>\\n<p>These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Mr. Trump, and then I\\'ll come to you Senator Kasich.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel\\'s enemies.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you senator. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump a response and then we\\'ll go to Governor Kasich.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.</p>\\n<p>But I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it\\'s tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel.</p>\\n<p>And some believe it\\'s possible. It may not be, in which case we\\'ll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, there\\'s no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in?</p>\\n<p>Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you\\'re familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They\\'re coming at them from above, they\\'re trying to come at them under the ground.</p>\\n<p>And I just have to tell you this, I don\\'t believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it\\'s going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix — to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq.</p>\\n<p>From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here\\'s the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that\\'s needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we\\'re not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We\\'re not using our overwhelming air power. We\\'re not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.</p>\\n<p>But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I\\'m glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re not able to fight. They\\'re not able to defend themselves. They\\'re not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that\\'s what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Hugh, I\\'ve said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I\\'m going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years.</p>\\n<p>We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer — is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.</p>\\n<p>And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be \"shock and awe\" in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that\\'s what it takes.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Mr. Trump, more troops?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> How many...[<em>crosstalk</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I would listen to the generals, but I\\'m hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we\\'re not allowed to fight. We can\\'t fight. We\\'re not knocking out the oil because they don\\'t want to create environmental pollution up in the air.</p>\\n<p>I mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we\\'re kidding. They didn\\'t want to knock out the oil because of what it\\'s going to do to the carbon footprint. We don\\'t fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don\\'t even know what we\\'re doing. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Mr. Trump.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.</p>\\n<p>Senator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.</p>\\n<p>What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that\\'s struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He\\'s struggling with the V.A.</p>\\n<p>The other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, \"Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail.\" Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen — one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died.</p>\\n<p>People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I\\'m proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I\\'ll give him credit — Bernie Sanders was a part of this — we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren\\'t doing a good job.</p>\\n<p>Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn\\'t working. The problem is no one\\'s being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one\\'s been fired for no outreach. No one\\'s been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one\\'s been disciplined. No one\\'s been demoted.</p>\\n<p>When I\\'m president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill.</p>\\n<p>Should veterans\\' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> I don\\'t — I haven\\'t seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.</p>\\n<p>Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.</p>\\n<p>And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans\\' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job.</p>\\n<p>And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they\\'re our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Governor Kasich. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.</p>\\n<p>Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let\\'s go back to my colleague Dana Bash.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made — after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime.</p>\\n<p>It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They\\'ll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people.</p>\\n<p>There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that\\'s changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.</p>\\n<p>And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.</p>\\n<p>He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It\\'s harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, I don\\'t really agree with President Obama. I think I\\'m somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making — as usual with our country, we don\\'t make good deal. We don\\'t have our right people negotiating, we have people that don\\'t have a clue.</p>\\n<p>As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody\\'s talking about it and they\\'ll end up signing a deal and then we\\'ll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.</p>\\n<p>All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don\\'t want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don\\'t agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be — should take place. After 50 years, it\\'s enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that\\'s going to happen.</p>\\n<p>This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it\\'s got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba\\'s favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba\\'s favor. It the same way as the Iran deal.</p>\\n<p>We never walked — we never — all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It\\'s the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don\\'t have to close it that way. Second of all, I don\\'t know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they\\'re going to lose. [<em>laughter and applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I\\'ll tell you what the good deal now, it\\'s already codified. Here\\'s a good deal — Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That\\'s a good deal. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.</p>\\n<p>There\\'s a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they\\'re doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn\\'t be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it\\'s got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it\\'s a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I\\'ve ever seen negotiated. So don\\'t try to put it on me like it\\'s wonderful, like I love it.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Senator Cruz, your response?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Well, look. I\\'ll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.</p>\\n<p>And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don\\'t just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.</p>\\n<p>We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies...[<em>bell rings</em>]...understands and doesn\\'t give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don\\'t negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don\\'t come back early — three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I\\'ve ever seen, by the way. If they don\\'t come back early, I was saying don\\'t negotiate. They come back early.</p>\\n<p>What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster.</p>\\n<p>Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.</p>\\n<p><strong>BASH:</strong> Thank you Mr. Trump. Let\\'s refocus this back on Cuba.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama\\'s policy in Cuba that we\\'ve been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> No, I wouldn\\'t. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don\\'t support us, we can\\'t figure out where you are.</p>\\n<p>You won\\'t arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.</p>\\n<p>And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there\\'s a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake.</p>\\n<p>You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here...[<em>applause</em>]...and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don\\'t own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we\\'ll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.</p>\\n<p>We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you\\'re either with us or you\\'re against us. We\\'re not rattling a sword. You\\'re not our enemy but we\\'re not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.</p>\\n<p>And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>When I\\'m president, they\\'re going to know exactly where we are because we\\'re coming back.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we\\'re discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening.</p>\\n<p>Mayor Regalado told me, quote, \"Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It\\'s an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?\" Unquote.</p>\\n<p>Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>There\\'s never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?</p>\\n<p>So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it\\'s caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.</p>\\n<p>And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there\\'s no such thing. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he\\'s forcing down our throats on the war on coal.</p>\\n<p>Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.</p>\\n<p>The businesses who are going to leave America because it\\'s more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.</p>\\n<p>And you know what passing those laws would have — what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he\\'s saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change.</p>\\n<p>When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he\\'s wrong?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass — if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.</p>\\n<p>One, because America is not a planet. It\\'s a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here\\'s what he will immediately — and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend — but here\\'s what he\\'s going to immediately going to start hearing from.</p>\\n<p>He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, I — I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don\\'t think it has to be a, you know, either you\\'re for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you\\'re not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both.</p>\\n<p>In our state, we\\'ve reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we\\'re trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power.</p>\\n<p>And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.</p>\\n<p>Now, it doesn\\'t mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don\\'t know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.</p>\\n<p>So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, \"foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed.\" Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Of course it does. And we\\'ve seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.</p>\\n<p>Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I\\'ll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, \"it is hard to be friends with America; we can\\'t count on America; America doesn\\'t stand with us.\"</p>\\n<p>And that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we\\'ve seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight.</p>\\n<p>It\\'s worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. [<em>applause</em>] And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That\\'s why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Senator.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China\\'s massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you\\'ve said: \"When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.\"</p>\\n<p>How do you respond...</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> That doesn\\'t mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn\\'t mean at all I was endorsing it.</p>\\n<p>As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn\\'t mean I\\'m endorsing Putin.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> But the word strong obviously is a compliment...[<em>applause</em>]...and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And strong doesn\\'t mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don\\'t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front — that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Now I will tell you, I don\\'t believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he\\'s doing, number one.</p>\\n<p>Number two, they need to realize they don\\'t own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we\\'re going to have to beef up the cyber command.</p>\\n<p>And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will.</p>\\n<p>And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can\\'t manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Governor Kasich.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re going to take another quick break. When we come back, we\\'ll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this. Stay with us.</p>\\n<p>[<em>commercial break</em>] [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.</p>\\n<p>Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, \"this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence.\" Do you believe that you\\'ve done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25, 30,000 people — you\\'ve seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest — in some cases — you know, you\\'re mentioning one case, which I haven\\'t seen, I heard about it, which I don\\'t like. But when they see what\\'s going on in this country, they have anger that\\'s unbelievable. They have anger.</p>\\n<p>They love this country. They don\\'t like seeing bad trade deals, they don\\'t like seeing higher taxes, they don\\'t like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know — I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There\\'s also great love for the country. It\\'s a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Some of your critics point to quotes you\\'ve made at these debates — at these rallies including February 23rd, \"I\\'d like to punch him in the face,\" referring to a protesters. February 27th, \"in the good ol\\' days, they\\'d have ripped him out of that seat so fast.\" February 1st, \"knock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\" [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don\\'t mind. But doing serious damage. And if they\\'ve got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something.</p>\\n<p>And it\\'s not me. It\\'s usually the municipal government, the police because I don\\'t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It\\'s usually the police — and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>So we should pay — we should truly give our police. They\\'re incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we\\'re working for. You know, we\\'ve seen for seven years a president who believes he\\'s above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he\\'s working for the American people.</p>\\n<p>And let me — let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y\\'all feel disrespected by Washington? [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Washington isn\\'t listening to the people. And that\\'s the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald\\'s rallies recently, he\\'s taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him.</p>\\n<p>Now, I got to say to me, I think that\\'s exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>And the only hand raising I\\'m interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the...[<em>bell rings</em>]...bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you senator.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, if you\\'d like to respond.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having — on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we\\'re talking and I\\'m saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say, hey, do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you\\'re going to vote for Donald Trump?</p>\\n<p>Everyone\\'s laughing, we\\'re all having a good time. That\\'s why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>But we\\'re all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many. Because when you look at it, everyone\\'s smiling, laughing. Their arms are raised like this. They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>It is a disgrace. It was a total disgrace. And I\\'ve had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that — what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party\\'s chances in November?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period. I mean, it\\'s — you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters.</p>\\n<p>Jake, here\\'s what I think is happening. There are people out there who are worried about their jobs. They\\'re worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they\\'re out of work and they\\'re 54 years old and they don\\'t know where they\\'re going to get another job, a man and a woman.</p>\\n<p>Maybe they\\'re worried about a trade deal. They\\'re worried about the fact that their wages haven\\'t gone up. They\\'re worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great.</p>\\n<p>They went to college, they rang up debt and they\\'re still living in their parents\\' basement. People are uptight. Our seniors are worried they\\'re going to lose their Social Security. There\\'s two ways to treat it.</p>\\n<p>You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed. If we\\'re Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems.</p>\\n<p>We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>And you know what? They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I\\'ll give them the power to do it.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you governor.</p>\\n<p>Senator Rubio? I know you want to say something.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> I do. A couple of points. The first is, I\\'m concerned about violence in general in this society. And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers. And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us.</p>\\n<p>On the issue of anger. Yes, people are angry. Of course they\\'re angry. Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years. But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us. But to motivate us to take action. Being here in Miami is special. My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up. And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history.</p>\\n<p>My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon.</p>\\n<p>[<em>bell rings</em>]</p>\\n<p>You know what he said when he saw that? He said Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything. There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you senator.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> And embrace all of the principles that made us great.</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you senator. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention. Let\\'s go back to Salem Radio\\'s Hugh Hewitt.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you Jake.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention. If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates. Why shouldn\\'t the person with the most delegates, even if it\\'s not a majority of delegates, be the nominee?</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, first of all, let\\'s not — you know, math doesn\\'t tell the whole story in politics. The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what\\'s true today is not necessarily true tomorrow. So let\\'s not get ahead of ourselves. Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK.</p>\\n<p>If you got an 86, you got a B. Because everybody else had an 84 didn\\'t mean you got an A. So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.</p>\\n<p>And frankly, I don\\'t know if we\\'re going to get a convention like that. But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him. He tried valiantly. He lost. Gerald Ford won. The party was united. Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon. He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first. And we were healed as a party.</p>\\n<p>So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked. But let\\'s not get ahead of ourselves. We don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected. And that\\'s what\\'s going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee? And if so, would you support that person?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever — first of all, I think I\\'m going to have the delegates. OK? I think. Let\\'s see what happens. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>But if somebody doesn\\'t have the delegates, and I guess there\\'s two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment. But if — no, that\\'s just — by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism. That\\'s just a mathematical fact. OK?</p>\\n<p>If two of us get up there, I would say this, if — if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win. That\\'s what I think.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Senator Cruz, if you — if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Well, look, there are some folks in Washington...</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Make me president. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention. They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee. I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>It\\'s one of the reasons why in the course of this election — listen, everyone up here has worked very hard. But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself. At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates. He has about 100 more than I have. We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him.</p>\\n<p>And so for the people at home, if you\\'re one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins. That\\'s why the media wants him to be the nominee so much. If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you\\'ve supported other candidates, come and join us.</p>\\n<p>We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting. It\\'s why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday. It\\'s why Mike Lee endorsed me today. I ask everyone to come together. Let\\'s stand together and let\\'s beat Hillary Clinton in November.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> All right. Thank you, Senator. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he\\'s always saying, \"I\\'m the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him.\" But I beat him in 13 contests. He never mentions that. [<em>applause</em>] And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact. I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted. The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken. And each week, I get better and better. And believe me, I haven\\'t even started on her yet.</p>\\n<p><strong>HEWITT:</strong> Senator Rubio?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Let me tell you what this election is about for me. And I get all the delegate math and all that debate. Let me tell you what\\'s about for me. On Tuesday night, I didn\\'t do as well, obviously, as I wanted to. And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home.</p>\\n<p>And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting. There\\'s a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery. And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting. But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says \"Marco Rubio.\"</p>\\n<p>Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day...[<em>applause</em>]...because this election is too important. What\\'s at stake is the future of this country. And I believe — I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I\\'ve always believed that God has blessed America, that God\\'s hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Senator. Let\\'s send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen?</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors. Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> I have not made that decision yet. I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision. My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth. I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I\\'m turning down money. I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you. I don\\'t know if I get any credit for it but I\\'m self-funding my campaign.</p>\\n<p>And other than — and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it\\'s not a large amount. No, I\\'m self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I\\'ve been in this business a long time and I was on the other side — until eight months ago I was on the or side. I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans. I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing.</p>\\n<p>I will say this — people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians. I don\\'t want anybody to control me but the people right out there. And I\\'m going to do the right thing. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Senator Cruz, I want to come to you. The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns. Do you deny that those big donors do have influence?</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> Well look, absolutely. And one of the things we\\'re so frustrated about is the corruption, what I\\'ve called the Washington cartel. It\\'s career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.</p>\\n<p>And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he\\'s been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party. And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change.</p>\\n<p>But the interesting point is tonight he hasn\\'t pointed to a single special interest he\\'s willing to take on. He didn\\'t take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street. He won\\'t take on ethanol. And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Thank you, Senator. I want to go to Mr. Trump...</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> $62 at tedcruz.org.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> ... for a response. Thank you, Senator.</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> That\\'s who you\\'ve got to be accountable to, the people.</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Ted was given to PACs. I mean, PACs — you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks. Very corrupt. It\\'s going to lead to lots of disasters. But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one. It\\'s very important to do that.</p>\\n<p>There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived. And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken. And I\\'m the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I\\'ve always made large contributions.</p>\\n<p>And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I\\'m the only one up here that\\'s going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question. At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible. With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren\\'t willing to show flexibility?</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn\\'t be flexible about your principles. About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that.</p>\\n<p>Listen, on the issue of higher education, I\\'m the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt. So I know this is a major issue. And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.</p>\\n<p>The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a — on a bipartisan basis. The sanctions that I helped — that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis. The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis.</p>\\n<p>But I also want to be frank. There are issues we\\'re going to have to have an election over. When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that\\'s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that\\'s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that\\'s probably not going to be bipartisan.</p>\\n<p>There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government. And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> All right. Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence. What are some of the other issues on which you\\'re willing to show flexibility?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> It depends on what comes up. You never know. It depends on what comes up. Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan. We had Tip O\\'Neill, speaker. And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully.</p>\\n<p>Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made. And he made it with Tip O\\'Neill. We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint. And I\\'ll tell you this, it can be done.</p>\\n<p>We don\\'t want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind. We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there\\'s total, absolute gridlock.</p>\\n<p><strong>DINAN:</strong> Thank you.</p>\\n<p>I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir.</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, look, my record speaks for itself. What I talk about tonight is not a theory. These are things that I\\'ve done. I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together. I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon. I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington. And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare,</p>\\n<p>I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor.</p>\\n<p>My problem isn\\'t that people don\\'t know this. They say, well, what does that mean? Does that mean you\\'re too easy? Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government.</p>\\n<p>In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years. Conservative principles will work. But show respect to the other side.</p>\\n<p>One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone. We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security. I know how to do it because I\\'ve done it and I\\'ll do it again. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>We have time for one last break. We\\'ll be right back after this. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p>[<em>commercial break</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> And we\\'re back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections. It is time now for closing statements. Candidates, you will each have one minute. And we\\'ll start with Governor Kasich.</p>\\n<p><strong>KASICH:</strong> Well, I\\'d like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision.</p>\\n<p>And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes being positive isn\\'t all that interesting, but it\\'s very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign.</p>\\n<p>I can fix the problems in Washington, I\\'ve done it before. And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty. We can do this together.</p>\\n<p>Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families. That\\'s where the spirit and strength of America is.</p>\\n<p>But ask the people — my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote. God bless. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Rubio.</p>\\n<p><strong>RUBIO:</strong> It\\'s great to be here, back at home in Miami. It\\'s hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city. And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land. My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else. They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves. And that was possible because America is a special country.</p>\\n<p>But that was not an accident. America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done. They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges. They embraced their opportunities. And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off.</p>\\n<p>And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part. And I\\'m telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I\\'m elected president, this generation will do it\\'s part.</p>\\n<p>We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Senator Cruz.</p>\\n<p><strong>CRUZ:</strong> What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support.</p>\\n<p>In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values? Who will best defend your values and fight for you?</p>\\n<p>I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, \"Madam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration. You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future.\"</p>\\n<p>We can do better. We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s the choice I will put to her this fall. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> Mr. Trump?</p>\\n<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it\\'s never known before. They\\'re coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are great people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again.</p>\\n<p>These are people that will win us the election and win it easily. These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job. Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you\\'re going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover. It will take centuries to recover.</p>\\n<p>So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party. And unify. Be smart and unify. [<em>applause</em>]</p>\\n<p><strong>TAPPER:</strong> And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate. We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching.</p>\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div class=\"field-prez-document-citation\">\\n    <p class=\"ucsbapp_citation\">Presidential Candidate Debates, Republican Candidates Debate in Miami, Florida Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

It has killed nearly , people around the world, and  dead and more than , known cases here in the United States. As a result, tonight's debate will focus heavily on the crisis.\n",
      "CALDERON: The setting of this debate is also different. To reduce unnecessary risk of transmission of the virus, CNN, Univision, the Democratic National Committee, and the campaigns moved this debate from Phoenix, Arizona, to here at CNN studios in Washington, without any audience.\n",
      "TAPPER: And all of this comes, of course, as four more states -- Florida, Arizona, Ohio, and Illinois -- prepare to vote on Tuesday, with Vice President Biden currently leading Senator Sanders in the race for delegates.\n",
      "Here's what we're going to do tonight. Each of you will have  seconds to answer questions and  seconds for responses and rebuttals. As much as we can, we hope this will be a conversation between the two of you.\n",
      "So let's begin with the most important issue right now: the coronavirus and what you would do as president in the face of it. Vice President Biden, let me start with you. We're in a reality right now that might have seemed unimaginable a week ago. Schools have been cancelled for more than  million students. Grocery store shelves have been cleared out. March Madness, NBA games, Disney parks, Broadway, small businesses all shut down, and just today, the CDC issued a new recommendation that for the next eight weeks events that consist of  people or more throughout the U.S. be cancelled or postponed.\n",
      "What do you say to the American people who are confronting this new reality?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, first of all, my heart goes out to those who have already lost someone or those who are suffering from the virus. And this is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to everybody move together.\n",
      "And, you know, I laid out in detail what I would do were I president today. You can go to joebiden.com. I laid it out in significant detail.\n",
      "But there are three pieces to this. First of all, we have to take care of those who, in fact, are exposed or likely to be exposed to the virus. And that means we have to do testing, we have to get the testing kits up and ready. I would have the World Health Organization, I'd take advantage of the test kits they have available to us, even though the president says a million or more are coming. Let's just get all the tests we can, done, as quickly as we can.\n",
      "Secondly, I would make sure that every state in the union had at least  places where they had drive-thru testing arrangements. I would also at this point deal with the need to begin to plan for the need for additional hospital beds. We have that capacity in the Department of Defense, as well as with the FEMA. And they can set up -bed, -bed hospitals and tents quickly. We have to lay all that out.\n",
      "But we have to deal with the economic fallout quickly. And that means making sure that people who, in fact, lose their job, don't get a paycheck, can't pay their mortgage, are able to pay it and pay them now. And do it now. Small businesses, be able to borrow interest-free loans.\n",
      "I see my time is up here. Are you going to hold us tightly, I assume, but that's what I would do. Go to Joebiden.com. It lays out precisely what I would do were I were president today.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders, this morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledged that it's possible that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans, could die from coronavirus in a worst-case scenario. If you were president right now, what's the most important thing you would do tonight to try to save American lives?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, firstly, we have to do -- whether or not I'm president, is to shut this president up right now, because he is undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people. It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with unfactual information, which is confusing the general public.\n",
      "Second of all, what we need to do -- and I'm glad that he has called a state of national emergency -- what we have got to do is move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country finally understands that when they get sick with the coronavirus, that they will -- that all payments will be made, that they don't have to worry about coming up with money for testing, they don't have to worry about coming up with money for treatment.\n",
      "This is an unprecedented moment in American history. Now, I obviously believe in Medicare for all. I will fight for that as president.\n",
      "But right now, in this emergency, I want every person in this country to understand that when you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for. Do not worry about the cost right now, because we're in the middle of a national emergency.\n",
      "Second of all, we have to make sure that our hospitals have the ventilators that they need, have the IC units that they need. Right now, we have a lack of medical personnel. And I worry very much that if there is a peak, whether we have the capability of dealing with hundreds of thousands of people who may be in hospitals.\n",
      "So we need unprecedented action right now to deal with the unprecedented crisis. And bottom line, from an economic point of view, what we have got to say to the American people, if you lose your job, you will be made whole. You're not going to lose income. If Trump can put -- or the Fed can president $. trillion into the banking system, we can protect the wages of every worker in America.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, President Trump says he does not take any responsibility for the problems with coronavirus testing, in part because, he says, he inherited so many rules, regulations, and red tape. Did bureaucratic red tape hamper this response in any way?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, look, the World Health Organization offered -- offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own. I think he said something like we have the best scientists in America, or something to that effect.\n",
      "The idea that we are not prepared for this and not -- and the other thing I want to point out. And I agree with Bernie. We're in a situation where we have to now be providing for the hospitals that are going to be needed, needed now. The present system cannot handle the surge that is likely to come.\n",
      "So we should already be sitting down and planning where we're going to put these temporary hospitals. And we can do that. We did that -- we've been through this before with the coronavirus. We've been through this -- I mean, excuse me, we've been through this before with dealing with the viruses that -- the HN -- as well as what happened in Africa. We provided these hospitals dealing with these great pandemics, and we were able to do it quickly. And people would have a place to go. But we also have to provide the equipment to protect the first responders. And that's not being done, either.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders, on that note -- and both of you have addressed this -- but, obviously, another major health concern right now for officials is the potential surge in patients all at once, overburdening hospitals, the health care system. You've mentioned ICU beds, both of you, and ventilators.\n",
      "We're already in the middle of flu season, so already a lot of those beds and ventilators are already being used. If you were president right now, what would you do to make sure every sick American is able to get treatment so the U.S. does not suffer the same fate as Italy, where doctors have to decide right now who gets life-saving treatment and who does not?\n",
      "SANDERS: Jake, let's be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current health care system. Now, we're spending twice as much per person on health care as the people of any other country. How in God's name does it happen that we end up with  million people who are uninsured or underinsured and there are people who are watching this program tonight who are saying, \"I'm not feeling well. Should I go to the doctor? But I can't afford to go to the doctor. What happens if I am sick? It's going to cost thousands of for treatment. Who's going to feed my kids?\"\n",
      "We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people. We're spending so much money and yet we are not even prepared for this pandemic. How come we don't have enough doctors? How come hospitals in rural areas are shutting down? How come people can't afford to get the prescription drugs they need because we have a bunch of crooks who are running the pharmaceutical industry, ripping us off every single day?\n",
      "And I'll tell you something right now. In the midst of this epidemic, you got people in the pharmaceutical industry who are saying, oh, wow, what an opportunity to make a fortune.\n",
      "So the word has got to go out, and I certainly would do this as president: You don't worry. People of America, do not worry about the cost of prescription drugs. Do not worry about the cost of the health care that you're going to get, because we are a nation -- a civilized democratic society. Everybody, rich and poor, middle class, will get the care they need. The drug companies will not rip us off.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, some medical experts are saying the only true way to control this virus is through a national quarantine, requiring every American, other than essential personnel, to stay home. Would you take that unprecedented step of a national lockdown?\n",
      "BIDEN: What I would do is what we did in our administration. I would call a meeting in the Situation Room of all the experts in America dealing with this crisis. I would sit them down and I would do exactly what we did then. What is it that we need? Listen to the experts. What do we need?\n",
      "And with all due respect for Medicare for all, you have a single-payer system in Italy. It doesn't work there. It has nothing to do with Medicare for all. That would not solve the problem at all.\n",
      "We can take care of that right now by making sure that no one has to pay for treatment, period, because of the crisis. No one has to pay for whatever drugs are needed, period, because of the crisis. No one has to pay for hospitalization because of the crisis, period. That is a national emergency, and that's how it's handled. It is not working in Italy right now, and they have a single-payer system.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well...\n",
      "BIDEN: Now, with regard to what else I would do, the fact is that we're in a position where I would bring together the leading experts in the world. Instead of doing this -- in the United States -- instead of doing this piecemeal, sit down and do what we did before with the Ebola crisis, what is needed and have one voice, one voice, like we did every day we met in that crisis in the Situation Room, laying out -- so we lay out overall, for all nation, what the best proposal is and how to move forward.\n",
      "In the absence of that, governors are making some sound decisions. They're doing the best they can by going out and getting the health care experts is their communities and their states to move. But it should be directed from the White House, from the Situation Room, laying out in detail like we did in the Ebola crisis. And we beat it.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you. Thank you. Senator Sanders, your response?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, first of all, the dysfunctionality of the current health care system is obviously apparent. As I said earlier, there are people who hesitate going to the doctor. You're going to have a maze of regulations -- well, if this is my income, if that's my income, can I get it, can I not get it? Clearly, we are not prepared. And Trump only exacerbates the crisis.\n",
      "When we spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, one might expect that we would have enough doctors all over this country. One might expect that we would have affordable prescription drugs. One might expect that we are preparing effectively for a pandemic that we were ready with the ventilators, with the ICUs, with the test kits that we need. We are not.\n",
      "And bottom line here is, in terms of Medicare for all, despite what the vice president is saying, what the experts tell us is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we don't have a system. We've got thousands of private insurance plans. That is not a system that is prepared to provide health care to all people.\n",
      "In a good year, without the epidemic, we're losing up to , people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time. It's clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse.\n",
      "BIDEN: That has nothing to do when you're in a national crisis. The national crisis says, we're responding. It's all free. You don't have to pay for a thing. That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy. This is a crisis. We're at war with the virus. We're at war with the virus. It has nothing to do with co-pays or anything. We just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this, period.\n",
      "SANDERS: That's not true.\n",
      "BIDEN: Period.\n",
      "SANDERS: As a matter of fact, that's not true. That law has enormous loopholes. I understand that Nancy Pelosi did her best, Republicans prevented it.\n",
      "BIDEN: No, I'm...\n",
      "SANDERS: What -- what you're talking about, Joe, here is enormous loopholes within that, that, in fact, it is not necessarily covering treatment for all people in America, and that people are going to be stuck with the bill unless we change that. And we're going to offer legislation to, in fact, change that.\n",
      "BIDEN: If I may, I offered legislation. I laid out on my plan that it would cover exactly what is not covered by the House. I laid out in the plan that I laid out for how we would deal with this crisis. Nobody -- nobody will pay for anything having to do with the crisis.\n",
      "This is a national emergency. There isn't a question of whether or not this is something that could be covered by insurance or anything else. We, out of the Treasury, are going to pay for this. It's a national emergency.\n",
      "SANDERS: But you see...\n",
      "BIDEN: That's what my plan calls for.\n",
      "SANDERS: But the weakness of this -- let's just do a hypothetical. Family member's diagnosed with the virus. Terrible tragedy, massive anxiety. The wife has the virus, the husband is a wreck, wants to go to a psychologist, wants to get counseling, doesn't have the money to do that.\n",
      "Maybe their kid breaks a leg. They don't have the money to go to health care. So you're saying right now, in the middle of a crisis, but, you know what, last year at least , people died in America because they didn't get health care when they should, because we don't have universal coverage.\n",
      "I think that's a crisis. One out of five people in America cannot afford the prescription drugs they need. They suffer. Some die. I consider that a crisis.\n",
      "Bottom line is, we need a simple system, which exists in Canada, exists in countries all over the world, and that is, if you are an American, you get the health care you need, end of discussion. We can save huge sums of money doing that. The trick is, do we have the guts to take on the health care industry, some of which is funding the vice president's campaign? Do we have the courage to take on the executives at the prescription drug industry, some of which -- some of whom are funding his campaign?\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, I -- this is a national crisis. I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here. I've laid out a plan, building on Obamacare, providing a public option of Medicare, it would cover everyone the same way. This idea that this is his only answer is a mistake in notion.\n",
      "But regardless of whether my plan was in place or his, this is a crisis. This is like we are being attacked from abroad. This is something that is of great consequence. This is like a war. And in a war, you do whatever is needed to be done to take care of your people.\n",
      "And what you do is you -- and I have proposed it, laid it out in detail -- everything that you need in terms of dealing with this crisis would be free. It is paid for by the taxpayers generally. Generally. It has nothing to do with Bernie's Medicare for all.\n",
      "And by the way...\n",
      "BASH: Vice President Biden, thank you.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me just...\n",
      "BASH: If I may, the vice president just mentioned war. Would you deploy the U.S. military in an effort to contain the virus? And if so, how?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I think we use all of the tools that make sense. And if using the National Guard, which is folks I think in New York state are already using the National Guard, that is something that has to be done.\n",
      "This is clearly, as the vice president indicated, a national emergency. And what I worry about is not only how we respond aggressively to the virus, but also how we respond aggressively to the economic fallout of a global recession.\n",
      "So right now, in Illinois and Ohio, if my memory is correct, the governor there has said they're closing down bars, they're closing down restaurants. What happens to the workers who are there? What happens to the millions of workers who may end up losing their jobs?\n",
      "So what I think we have got to do right now is, if Trump can provide or the Fed can provide a trillion and a half to -- for liquidity for the banks, what we've got to say to every worker in America, you know what, don't panic. You're not going to -- you'll be able to pay your mortgage, because you're going to get a check.\n",
      "BASH: Senator...\n",
      "SANDERS: You're going to be made whole.\n",
      "BASH: Senator, we're going to talk about the economic -- oh, go ahead, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: The answer is I would call out the military.\n",
      "BASH: OK.\n",
      "BIDEN: Now. They have the capacity to provide this surge, help that hospitals need, and that is needed across the nation. I would make sure that they did exactly what they're prepared to do. They've done it. They did it in the Ebola crisis. They've done it. They have the capacity to build -bed hospitals and -- and tents that are completely safe and secure, and provide the help to get it done to anybody -- this overflow. So it is a national emergency. I would call out the military.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, the Ebola crisis is one thing. This is, obviously, a pandemic, which is far more severe and impactful to this country. And I think one of the things that we want to remember here is that we got a lot of elderly people in this country who are told stay home, don't leave your house. Who's going to get food to them? How do we get food to them?\n",
      "You got schools all over this country now being shut down. OK? How are we going to make sure that the kids do well in this crisis, not become traumatized? What do we do about the parents now who have to stay home with kids and can't go to work?\n",
      "So I think what -- bottom line here is that, in this crisis, we have got to start paying attention to the most vulnerable. That includes people who are in prison right now, people who are in homeless shelters right now. What about the half-a-million people who are homeless tonight? Who's going to respond to them?\n",
      "Now, in , when we had the Wall Street bailout, they did very well for the people on top. They bailed out the crooks on Wall Street. They forgot about the suffering of ordinary Americans. This time around, let us learn that lesson. Let us pay attention to the working families of this country...\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "SANDERS: ... and to the most vulnerable.\n",
      "BIDEN: We have -- we have learned that lesson. And again, I lay out in detail what we should be doing now is we should be surging help to those places which are the most vulnerable. We should have every single person that's in a nursing home being able to be tested. We should be moving forces in to do that. We should move in the capability to do that.\n",
      "We should be sitting down -- the president should be sitting down in the Situation Room right now and do what we did before and asking the question, OK, you're going to close everything. Well, if you close everything, how do you get prescriptions that have to be filled? How do you make sure, when you close that school, those children are going to be able to get the school food program? How do you make sure that you're going to be able to see to it that you get your mortgage paid?\n",
      "BIDEN: ... covered, and it's going to take a multi-multi-billion dollar program to do that.\n",
      "But first things first, the first thing is take care of the the immediate needs we have now relating to surging the kind of capability that we have to prevent this great bump in terms of this -- how it's going to cause such pain as well as moving in the direction of making sure we have a long-term plan to make sure it's...\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We're going to talk in a moment a lot more about the economic impact.\n",
      "But first, Senator Sanders, I want to ask about China. When this outbreak first started in China, the government there censored the whistleblower doctor who sounded the alarm and downplayed the true gravity of the the virus.\n",
      "SANDERS: Right.\n",
      "BASH: What consequences should China face for its role in this global crisis?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, one of the consequences is we have got to learn that you cannot lie to the American people. You cannot be less than frank about the a nature of the crisis. And what bothers me very much is you have a president of the United States today, Mr. Trump, who is praising China for the good work that they are doing when, in fact, as you indicated, they were lying to their own people and allowing that virus to move much more aggressively than should have been the case.\n",
      "Look, I don't think this is the time for recrimination, to be punishing people. Now is the time, by the way, to be working with China. They are learning a lot about this crisis. And, in fact, they -- you know, we have got to work with them. We have got to work with the World Health Organization. We have got to work with Italy. We have got to work with countries around the world.\n",
      "If there was ever a moment when the entire world is in this together, got to support each other, this is that moment.\n",
      "BIDEN: That's right. And if I may respond, that's why I insisted the moment this broke out that we should insist on having our experts in China, in China to see what was happening and make it clear to China there would be consequences if we did not have that access.\n",
      "And we have to lead the world. We should be the ones doing what we did during the Ebola crisis, bringing the whole world together and saying, this is what we must do. We have to have a common plan. All nations are affected the same way by this virus depending on exposure.\n",
      "And so this is -- we need world leadership. We need international leadership. We need someone who knows how to bring the world together and insist on fundamental change in the way in which we're approaching this.\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, the bottom line here is that in the midst of this crisis, we have got to act in an unprecedented way. And that means every country on Earth is going to be affected. Every country on Earth has got to work together. It also means that we tell the pharmaceutical industry, we tell the big money interests that this is not a time for profiteering. This is a time for all of us working together.\n",
      "The World Health Organization is a very, very strong organization. It is sad that we have a president that has ignored the international community in so many ways, including in terms of international health crises.\n",
      "CALDERON: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n",
      "Obviously, another part of this story is the economy, which is reeling from this pandemic. Many economies are warning of a recession. Just hours ago the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero percent, which has not happened since the financial crisis in .\n",
      "Vice President Biden, what would you do?\n",
      "BIDEN: What I would do is make it clear to the world and make it clear to the United States that we are going to have to have a major, major, major, major bailout package that we do not reward corporations. We reward individuals who in fact are really put to the test here.\n",
      "The problem is the policies of this administration economically have -- we've eaten a lot of our seed corn here. The ability for us to use levers that were available before have been used up by this godawful tax cut of $. trillion, by the fact that we have used -- the Fed will be of little consequence now. They have already used what leverage they have.\n",
      "And so we're going to have to just level with the American people. And here's the deal, we're going to have to not only deal with the immediate crisis, economic crisis, which is the most critical now, to let people know their mortgage is going to be paid. Their rents are going to be paid. They are going to have child care. They are going to make sure that all their medical bills are cared for relating to this, et cetera.\n",
      "We have to go beyond that. And we're going to have be in a situation where we're meeting on a daily basis like we did in the middle of the financial crisis to decide how we are going to find the wherewithal and the money to be able to see to it we hold all these folks harmless. But not, not do what Trump wants to do. He's -- for example, he came along and said, I've got a great idea, let's -- well, you're going to tell me...\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: The Ebola crisis, in my view, exposes the dysfunctionality of the health care system and how poorly prepared we are despite how much money that we spend. And the Ebola crisis is also, I think, exposing the cruelty and the unjustness of our economy today.\n",
      "We have more income and wealth inequality in America today than any time in  years. And what that means that in the midst of this crisis, you know, if you're a multimillionaire, no one is happy about this crisis, you're going to get through it. You're going to get everything you need. You're not worried about health care. You're not worried about income coming in.\n",
      "Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We've got people who are struggling working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What is going to happen to them? So the lesson to be learned is we have got to move aggressively right now to address the economic crisis as a result of Ebola -- as a result -- keep talking about Ebola, you've got Ebola in my head here right now.\n",
      "As a result of the virus here, the coronavirus, what we have got to do also is understand the fragility of the economy and how unjust and unfair it is that so few have so much and so many have so little.\n",
      "BIDEN: People are looking for results, not a revolution. They want to deal with the results they need right now. And we can to that by making sure that we make everybody whole who has been so badly hurt. In terms of their -- they lose the job, in terms of not having the ability to care for their children, in terms of the health care costs that they have relating to the crisis, we can make them whole now, now, and put in process a system whereby they all are made whole.\n",
      "That has nothing to do with the legitimate concern about income inequality in America. That's real. That's real. But that does not affect the need for us to act swiftly and very thoroughly and in concert with all of the forces that we need to bring to bear to deal with the crisis now so no one is thrown out of their home. No one loses their mortgage. No one is kicked out of their house. No one loses their paycheck. No one is in a position where they have a significant financial disability as a consequence of this SARS -- of this particular crisis.\n",
      "CALDERON: Thank you, Vice President.\n",
      "Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I think it goes without saying that as a nation we have to respond as forcefully as we can to the current crisis. But it is not good enough not to be understanding how we got here and where we want to go into the future. So how does it happen that today in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, half of our people are scared to death?\n",
      "Good, I agree. In fact, that was my idea originally to make sure that every person in this country is made whole as a result of this crisis. But, God willing, this crisis is going to end. And we're going to have to develop an economy in which half of our people are not living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to put food on the table.\n",
      "BIDEN: I don't disagree with that. Let's -- you were asking about the crisis. What are we going to do about the crisis now, which is incredibly consequential to millions and millions of Americans? And it's not going to be solved by a change in tax policy now. It's not going to be solved by a change in how we deal with health care.\n",
      "It has got to be solved with an emergency need right now. Right now, what do we do? First thing we do is we make sure that health care is available by us having the tools to be able to deal with it. And that requires us to go out and do much more than this president has done in terms of planning.\n",
      "Secondly, it requires us to be in a position where we're anticipating what will happen in the next month or weeks in terms of the flow into the health care system by bringing the military along, more hospital beds, more training, more equipment, more equipment to save the first responders as well.\n",
      "In addition to that, we then have to also look at what are the immediate needs right today. How about that person who has been laid off today? How about that person who doesn't have an income today? They have to know that tomorrow that when the paycheck comes due, you will get that paycheck.\n",
      "And thirdly, we have to think long-term about how we deal with making all those who have been badly damaged right again. And then we move on. Then we move on to change the economy in ways that are more profoundly necessary than people think, but do not respond to the immediate needs we have now. First things first.\n",
      "CALDERON: Thank you, Vice President.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, you voted against bailouts following the  financial crisis.\n",
      "SANDERS: Yes.\n",
      "CALDERON: Many believe those spending bills were a crucial part of stabilizing the economy back then. Would you support bailouts for industries that are being crushed by the coronavirus outbreak now?\n",
      "SANDERS: I did, you're quite right. I voted against the bailout because I believed that the illegal behavior being done by the people on Wall Street should not be rewarded by a bailout. And today, by the way, those banks are more prosperous and own more assets, by and large, than they did back then. They are bigger now than they were then.\n",
      "I thought at the time that in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality the people on top, through a surtax on the very wealthy, should bail out. And it's not just the TARP bailout. We gave trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to large banks.\n",
      "But to answer your question where we are right now, we need to stabilize the economy, but we can't repeat what we did in . Joe voted for that. I voted against it. Because we have got to do more than save the banks or the oil companies. Our job right now is to tell every working person in this country, no matter what your income is, you are not going to suffer as a result of this crisis of which you had no control.\n",
      "CALDERON: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Had those banks all gone under, all those people Bernie says he cares about would be in deep trouble. Deep, deep trouble. All those little folks, we would have gone out of business. They would find themselves in position where they would lose everything they had in that bank, whether it was $ or $ or a savings account.\n",
      "This was about saving an economy. And it did save the economy. And the banks paid back. And they paid back with interest. I agree with Bernie. Someone should have gone to jail. That was the big disagreement I had in terms of bailing out. But the question was, they paid back.\n",
      "In addition to that, it also -- part of that was bailing out the automobile industry. Saving thousands of jobs. Tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against that as well.\n",
      "SANDERS: No. I did not vote against that. That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry.\n",
      "But here's the point.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "SANDERS: One minute, one minute. Here's the point here, is that in terms of that bailout, there are ways that you can bail out. When you have a handful of people who have incredible wealth who have prospered off of the illegal behavior of individuals, in this case on Wall Street, you know what you say to them? And I did. I said this to the secretary of treasury. You want a bailout? That's fine. Have your friends pay for it, not working people.\n",
      "The other point is, Joe should know, it wasn't just the $ billion TARP program. The Fed gave trillions and trillions of dollars in zero interest loans to every financial institution in this country and central banks all over the world. That was essentially a grant. Because they then could sell that -- they could then bring in interest rates much greater than the zero interest loans that they got.\n",
      "CALDERON: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, the fact of the matter is that if, in fact, the banks had all been -- gone under, we would be in a great depression. We would have not -- how do you get out of that? Now Bernie is saying that I guess he's going to do a wealth tax or something, that the top  percent could pay for everything. And they should pay for everything that occurred.\n",
      "We were talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars. That's what this was about. And the fact was that it saved the economy from going into a depression. After we passed the Recovery Act, which I was the one that went out and got the three votes to get it changed, that had $ billion in it and was the thing that kept us from going into a great depression.\n",
      "CALDERON: Vice President Biden, I'm going to stay with you. Many of the  million undocumented immigrants and now even many legal immigrants in the United States are afraid to seek medical help. How do you ensure they feel safe enough to get treatment to help stop the spread of coronavirus?\n",
      "BIDEN: Anyone who shows up to be tested for coronavirus or gets coronavirus and is treated would be held harmless. Just like I have argued all along. Any woman who crosses the border or is here and being beaten by her husband but she's undocumented, she cannot be deported because she reports.\n",
      "There are certain things you cannot deport an undocumented alien for -- an undocumented person for. And that would be one of them. We want them -- it's in the interest of everyone. And those folks who are the xenophobic folks out there, it's even in their interest that that woman come forward or that man come forward because it deals with keeping the spread from moving more rapidly.\n",
      "They will not, should not under any circumstances be held accountable and be deported for that purpose, period.\n",
      "SANDERS: I have been criticized because the proposal for Medicare for All that I introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered. And right now, we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing, they're sick, they want to go to...\n",
      "SANDERS: I have been criticized because the proposal for Medicare For All that I introduced includes making sure that undocumented people are also covered.\n",
      "And right now, we have the absurd situation where undocumented people who try to do the right thing -- they're sick; they want to go to the doctor; they don't want to spread this disease -- are now standing and thinking about when ICE is going to deport them.\n",
      "So one of the things that we have to do is to make sure that everybody feels comfortable getting the health care that they need. That should be a general principle, above and beyond the coronavirus.\n",
      "Second of all, we've got to end these terrible ICE raids, which are terrorizing communities all over this country.\n",
      "And thirdly, to answer your question, the time is long overdue for this country to move to comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for those  million undocumented. And furthermore, on day one as president, I would restore the legal status of the . million...\n",
      "BASH: Senator -- Senator thank you...\n",
      "SANDERS: young people of DACA.\n",
      "BASH: We're going to talk about immigration in a minute. But first I want to ask about something that's going on right now, again, back to this crisis.\n",
      "We know that people over the age of  and those with underlying medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, are the most vulnerable to coronavirus and are being asked to change their behavior to protect themselves.\n",
      "So Senator Sanders, I'll start with you. You're  years old. You had a heart attack. What are you doing to protect yourself\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, a great deal. I mean, last night we had a -- a fireside chat, not a rally. I love doing rallies and we bring many thousands of people out to our rallies. I enjoy it very much. We're not doing that right now. In fact, our entire staff is working from home.\n",
      "So on a personal level, what we're doing is I'm not shaking hands. Joe and I did not shake hands. [laughter]\n",
      "And I am very careful about the people I am interacting with. I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection. And I have to say, you know, thank God, right now, I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that.\n",
      "BASH: Vice President Biden, you're . What are you doing to protect yourself?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, fortunately, I don't have any of the underlying conditions you talked about that I have to worry about, number one.\n",
      "Number two, thank God, for the time being -- anything can happen, as my mother would say, knock on wood, that I'm in good health.\n",
      "Number three, I'm taking all the precautions anyone would take, whether they are  years old or  years old or  years old. And that is I'm going to make sure that I do not -- I do not shake hands any longer; I do not engage -- we did the same thing. Our staff is all working from home. We are not doing rallies any longer. We're doing virtual rallies. We're doing virtual town hall meetings.\n",
      "We're in a situation where now I do not -- as I said, when we encounter people, we're not going into crowds. And so I'm taking all the precautions everyone else should be taking. I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap. I carry with me -- as a matter of fact, I have it in my bag outside here -- hand sanitizer. I don't know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don't touch my face, and so on. So I'm taking all the precautions we're told for everybody else to take.\n",
      "TAPPER: Let's turn to the race more broadly now. Throughout this campaign, you have each laid out starkly different visions for how to bring about change.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. You said people want results, not a revolution. Make the case for why a revolution is not what the country needs or wants\n",
      "BIDEN: We have problems we have to solve now -- now. What's a revolution going to do, disrupt everything in the meantime?\n",
      "Look, Bernie talks about -- excuse me -- the senator talks about his Medicare For All. He still hasn't told you how he's going to ever get it passed. He hasn't told you how in fact there's any possibility of that happening. He hasn't told you how much it's going to cost. He hasn't told you how it's going to apply. It doesn't kick in for four years even after it passes.\n",
      "We want a revolution, let's act now. Pass the Biden health care plan, which takes Obamacare, restores all the cuts made to it, subsidizes it further, provides for lower drug prices, makes sure that there's no hidden bills, makes sure that we invest -- what I want to invest, $ billion in dealing with underlying diseases that are of great consequence, diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer. Make sure that we have a Medicare option that's in a -- a public option providing Medicare for us.\n",
      "We can do that now. I can get that passed. I can get that done, if I'm president of the United States of America. That will be a fundamental change, and it happens now.\n",
      "I can tell you from experience, being a significant consumer of health care, with my sons, my family, all the things we've gone through, what people want is hope, and they need it now, not four years from now. And Bernie still hasn't cost -- told us how he's going to pay for it. We're talking about a...\n",
      "SANDERS: Not quite true.\n",
      "BIDEN: ... -plus trillion dollar plan.\n",
      "SANDERS: Not quite true.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Look, let's do something that is very rarely done in the Congress.\n",
      "BIDEN: OK.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let's do something that the media doesn't do. Let's talk about the reality of American life. Why is it that, over the last  years, despite the huge increase in productivity and technology, the average worker today is not making a nickel more in real dollars?\n",
      "Why is it that, over the last  years, the richest  percent have seen a $ trillion increase in their wealth; the bottom half of America, a $ billion decline in their wealth?\n",
      "Why is that we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right?\n",
      "Why are we the only major country not to have paid medical and family leave?\n",
      "Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires when half a million people are homeless today?\n",
      "And it comes down to something, Jake, we don't talk about, the power structure in America. Who has the power?\n",
      "And I'll tell you who has the power. It's the people who contribute money, the billionaires who contribute money to political campaigns, who control the legislative agenda. Those people have the power.\n",
      "And if you want to make real changes in this country; if you want to create an economy that works for all, not just the few; if you want to guarantee quality health care to all, not make $ billion in profit for the health care industry, you know what you need?\n",
      "You need to take on Wall Street; you need to take on the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry. You don't take campaign contributions from them. You take them on and create an economy that works for all.\n",
      "BIDEN: You want to do that, do what I proposed over  years ago. Federally fund all elections, no private contributions in the election process. If you want to do that, join me. Join me and my constitutional amendment that I've been proposing. Maybe you and I can work on that together. Because that would fundamentally change it.\n",
      "And the complication is I'm getting these -- I've not accepted a contribution from anybody over $,, number one. My average contribution is $. Just this month I've raised $ million, average contribution, $. The idea that this is -- Bernie's implication is somehow I'm being funded by millionaires.\n",
      "Bernie, look, in the last -- in Super Tuesday and before that, Bernie outspent me two, three, four, five, six to one. And I still won. I didn't have any money. And I still won.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: It's good that you had an idea  years ago. I don't want to join you. Why don't you join me?\n",
      "Why don't you get rid of the SuperPAC that you have right now -- which is running very ugly negative ads about me, by the way...[laughter]\n",
      "SANDERS: Don't laugh, Joe. That's just the truth. [laughter]\n",
      "And they've got two other SuperPACs runnings ads against us.\n",
      "Why don't you just say, right now -- go on television and say, \"Hey, you know what\" -- I think, in the past, Joe, if I'm not mistaken, you condemned SuperPACs. Is that correct?\n",
      "BIDEN: You get rid of the nine Super PACs you have?\n",
      "SANDERS: I don't -- nine...[laughter]\n",
      "I don't have any SuperPACs.\n",
      "BIDEN: You have nine. Do you want me to list them?\n",
      "SANDERS: No -- yeah. You go ahead and list them.\n",
      "BIDEN: OK. Come on. Give me a break. Come on.\n",
      "SANDERS: No, I won't give you a break on this one, Joe. You condemn SuperPACs. You've got a SuperPAC is running negative -- but here's the point. This is the point. In the richest country in the history of the world, half of our people should not be struggling to put food on the table.\n",
      "And the reason for that is you have a political structure in which big money interests not only dominate the political system but dominate our economy as well. Somebody makes a decision we're going to shut down a factory in America; we're going to move to China; we're going to move to Mexico, pay people starvation wages there.\n",
      "This is an issue that has got to be ultimately deal with. Who has the power in America? Are we content with so few exercising so much power when so many people have given up on the political process?\n",
      "BIDEN: I proposed a significant change in the tax code and I've been proposing it for a long, long time, number one.\n",
      "Number two, it's not just about taxing the super-wealthy. It's about making sure everybody pays their fair share. For example, I can pay for my whole health care plan by changing the way in which we deal with capital gains. People should pay their capital gains based on what their income tax is and not  percent.\n",
      "That would raise $ billion, pay for my entire medical health care plan, which would cover everyone.\n",
      "The fact of the matter is, everything I call for, I pay for. And I do not believe, and I have not supported these exorbitant tax cuts for the wealthy. I strongly opposed the -- the tax cut that this president has put through of $. trillion. And I said at the time this was all about trying to eliminate the safety net.\n",
      "Look, the idea that Bernie implies, the way he says things, speaking of negative ads, my Lord, Bernie, you're running an ad saying I'm opposed to Social Security, that Politifact says is a flat lie, and that The Washington Post said is a flat lie.\n",
      "SANDERS: Oh, well, let me ask you a question, Joe.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yeah.\n",
      "SANDERS: You're right here with me.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yeah.\n",
      "SANDERS: Have you been on the floor of the Senate -- you were in the Senate for a few years...\n",
      "BIDEN: Yep.\n",
      "SANDERS: ... time and time again talking about the necessity -- with pride -- about cutting Social Security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans' programs.\n",
      "BIDEN: No.\n",
      "SANDERS: You never said that?\n",
      "BIDEN: No.\n",
      "SANDERS: All right. America, go to the website right now. Go to the YouTube right now. Time after time -- you were not a fan of Bowles-Simpson?\n",
      "BIDEN: I was not a fan of Bowles...\n",
      "SANDERS: You were not a fan of the Balanced Budget Amendment, which called for cuts in Social Security?\n",
      "Come on, Joe, you were.\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, here's the deal.\n",
      "SANDERS: You're an honest guy. Why don't you just tell the truth here? We all make mistakes.\n",
      "BIDEN: No, I am telling the truth. You said that I in fact -- why am I rated  percent by the Social Security organizations?\n",
      "Why am I viewed as a strong supporter...\n",
      "SANDERS: All that I said...\n",
      "BIDEN: I have laid out how I will increase Social Security.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, that's good. I laid that out...\n",
      "BIDEN: I have laid out how I'm going to make sure...\n",
      "SANDERS: OK, let me...\n",
      "BIDEN: ... that it is in fact paid for.\n",
      "SANDERS: Jake...\n",
      "BIDEN: Go to joebiden.com, look at my exchange with Paul Ryan on his desire to try to privatize and/or cut Social Security...\n",
      "SANDERS: OK.\n",
      "BIDEN: ... and understand how he manipulated an ad.\n",
      "SANDERS: No -- all right. Let me repeat it again. I want you just to be straight with the American people. I am saying that you have been on the floor of the Senate, time and time again, talking about the need to cut Social Security, Medicare and veterans' programs. Is that true or is that not true?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, it's not true.\n",
      "SANDERS: That is not true?\n",
      "BIDEN: That is not true.\n",
      "What is true is, in terms of the negotiations that are taking place, how to deal with the deficit, everything was on the table. I did not support any of those cuts, in Social Security or in veterans' benefits...\n",
      "SANDERS: Whoa -- whoa -- you -- everything was on the table. All right. You're right. You just said it -- including, in your judgment, cuts to Social Security and veterans...\n",
      "BIDEN: In order to get the kinds of changes we need on other things related...\n",
      "SANDERS: Joe, then you just...\n",
      "BIDEN: But we didn't -- but we did not cut it. I did not vote for it.\n",
      "SANDERS: I know, because people like me helped stop that.\n",
      "BIDEN: Oh, come on, Bernie.\n",
      "SANDERS: But, Joe, you just contradicted yourself.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "BIDEN: Joe, you just contradicted yourself. One minute...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "BIDEN: Excuse me. One minute you said \"I was not on the floor.\" The next minute you say, \"Well, yes, there was a reason why I was worried about the deficit.\"\n",
      "Maybe that's good reason, maybe it's not. All that I am saying is you were prepared to cut and advocated for the cuts of programs...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "BASH: So let me...\n",
      "BIDEN: I did not. I never voted to cut Social Security.\n",
      "SANDERS: I'm not talking about voting, Joe. That's not what I said.\n",
      "BIDEN: I never voted -- well, look, I voted to protect it. I was -- just go look at the debate with Paul Ryan for the vice presidency. Look at what I did.\n",
      "And, Bernie, will you acknowledge your campaign took out of context that whole exchange between Paul Ryan. Are you saying Politifact is wrong? Are you saying...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, believe me, The Washington Post, Politifact is wrong a whole lot of times. But...\n",
      "BIDEN: Are they wrong on that, Bernie? Are they wrong on that, Bernie?\n",
      "SANDERS: Joe..\n",
      "BIDEN: Bernie, did you...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "SANDERS: Did -- Joe, wait a minute. I'll answer your question. You answer mine.\n",
      "BIDEN: I answered yours.\n",
      "SANDERS: No, you didn't.\n",
      "BIDEN: All right.\n",
      "SANDERS: One more time. Were you on the floor, time and time again, for whatever reason, talking about the need to cut Social Security and Medicare and veterans' programs?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, I did not talk about the need to cut any of those programs.\n",
      "SANDERS: OK. All that I would say to the American people, go to YouTube. It's all over the place. Joe said it many, many times. And I'm surprised -- you know, you can defend or change your mind on it, but you can't deny the reality.\n",
      "BASH: So, Senator, because you brought up Social Security and you have been talking about it, I want to ask you about something that you wrote in . You were a member of the House and you wrote an op-ed that said, quote, \"It is clear we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits.\"\n",
      "SANDERS: Yeah.\n",
      "BASH: Why are your past comments any less relevant than the vice president's?\n",
      "SANDERS: Incremental adjustments. What I advocated -- adjustments that I advocated and have advocated for years is among other things increasing the cost of living assistance.\n",
      "No, you're not going to find me ever calling for cuts to Social Security. Right now, for example, we determined [inaudible] looking at inflation for the general population rather than segregating the higher costs that seniors are paying for prescription drugs and for health care. That's what I was talking about.\n",
      "I have -- in fact, when Joe and others were enamored with the so-called Bowles-Simpson, which included cuts to Social Security or raising the retirement age, I formed, along with people like Barbara Boxer, the Defending Social Security Caucus to say, no, when  percent of our seniors are trying to get by on $, a year or more, we are not going to cut Social Security.\n",
      "CALDERON: Vice President Biden, yesterday you endorsed an Elizabeth Warren plan that would undo key parts of the bankruptcy law you helped pass in . A few hours ago, you announced support for making public college tuition-free for families who make less than $, a year, something Senator Sanders has supported. What changed?\n",
      "BIDEN: Two things. Number one, let's talk about the bankruptcy bill. The bankruptcy bill was passing overwhelmingly, and I improved it. I had a choice, it was going to pass, Republican president, Republican Congress, and I offered two amendments to make sure that people under $, would not be affected and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments. That's what I did. It passed overwhelmingly. I did not like the rest of the bill, but I improved it, number one.\n",
      "Number two, I've talked with Senator Warren about her proposal. This is the first opportunity we've had to make substantial change in what we couldn't get done in a Republican administration. That's why we talked last -- two nights ago, and I supported her proposal. And it's a good proposal, it's a solid proposal. And she should get credit for having introduced it.\n",
      "With regard to what we're talking about in terms of college education, I've been saying for a long time that we're in a position where  years of education is not enough, is not enough for the st century. We need  years of education. The exact bill that the -- that Senator Sanders introduced of -- I guess a little over a year ago, capping it off at $, in income, you could get free up to that point, after that, you'd have to pay for your college education, it'd only work for public schools and it would work for public universities in your state. I support that idea.\n",
      "It was a good idea. And I support it. And so that's -- that's what it is. And I'm not saying everything Bernie said has been wrong. He happens to be right on that one.\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders, I assume you welcome these changes?\n",
      "SANDERS: Look, this is a little bit about leadership, as well. Joe talked about bankruptcy. Joe, if I memory is correct, you helped write that bankruptcy bill.\n",
      "BIDEN: I did not.\n",
      "SANDERS: All right.\n",
      "BIDEN: I did not\n",
      "SANDERS: And that bankruptcy bill -- by the way, we talk about education, we've got  million people in America struggling with student debt. Some of them really struggling with student debt. And that bankruptcy bill made it impossible or very difficult for people to escape from that student debt. It was a very, very bad bill.\n",
      "You said, Joe, that a majority of the people in the Senate voted for it. You're right.\n",
      "BIDEN: Overwhelming majority.\n",
      "SANDERS: Overwhelmingly. Well, I voted against it in the House and I was right. And I don't have to rethink my position, because that's what leadership is about, having the guts to take an unpopular vote.\n",
      "But it's not just bankruptcy. The difference between Joe and I on higher education is, four years ago, it was not a popular idea, Joe. Glad you're coming around now. Four years ago, when I said that public colleges and university should be tuition free, people were saying, Bernie, that's a radical idea. Well, you got states and cities and counties all over the country that are moving in that direction.\n",
      "And I'm glad that Joe is on board. But what leadership is about is going forward when it's not popular, when it's an idea that you get criticized for. So I'm proud of that fact, and I'm proud of my leadership on many issues. Joe, since the campaign, has come around. I talked about raising that minimum wage $ bucks an hour four years ago, Joe.\n",
      "BIDEN: So did I. And I went out and campaigned for it.\n",
      "SANDERS: Fifteen dollars an hour?\n",
      "BIDEN: Fifteen dollars an hour. New York City. Go talk to the governor.\n",
      "SANDERS: I will talk to the governor.\n",
      "BIDEN: All right?\n",
      "SANDERS: I am not aware of that. I am not aware of that.\n",
      "BIDEN: You should be aware. Look...\n",
      "SANDERS: Four years ago, it was a radical idea. Very few people in Congress were talking about it.\n",
      "BIDEN: I wasn't in...\n",
      "CALDERON: Go ahead, Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, here, look. Let's get something straight about the bankruptcy bill. The bankruptcy bill already -- it did not affect student debt for  percent, because the law had already been passed. You could not declare bankruptcy for those loans that were from private institutions. You couldn't do it. And so the bankruptcy bill didn't affect that. It affected  percent of the people, the first bankruptcy bill,  percent of the student loans, number one.\n",
      "Number two, now we're in a position where we're able to correct that problem. The fact is if I hadn't stepped up and changed the law as it relates to people making less than $,, those for alimony and child support, then, guess what, they would have been in the bucket, too. It was going to pass anyway. I made it -- let me finish. I made it incrementally better. I did not like the bill. I did not support the bill. And I made it clear to the industry I didn't like the bill.\n",
      "Number two, this bill now calls for the opportunity to fundamentally change the mistakes we couldn't correct in the bill the first time around. And that is why I support Elizabeth Warren's idea. And it's a very good idea.\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders, go ahead.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, this is kind of circular logic. We're going to reform the bill that I voted for. Well, if you hadn't voted for it, and if you had rallied other people, as I tried to do in the House voting against it, we might not have the problems with it we have today.\n",
      "You know, what leadership is about, Joe, and it deals with -- you know, whether your opposition -- or your support, I should say, for legislation -- for legislation regarding gay communities in the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. You remember that bill, right? You remember the Defense of Marriage Act?\n",
      "BIDEN: I sure do.\n",
      "SANDERS: It was -- you know, gay marriage today is considered a Little bit differently than it was  years ago. I remember that vote. It was a very hard vote. I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act. You voted for it. I voted against the bankruptcy bill. You voted for it. I voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote. You voted for it.\n",
      "I voted against disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA and PNTR with China, which cost this country over  million good-paying jobs. You voted for it. I voted against the Hyde amendment, which denies low-income women the right to get an abortion. You have consistently voted for it. I don't know what your position is on it today, but you have consistently voted for it.\n",
      "In other words, all that I'm saying here, we can argue about the merits of the bill.\n",
      "CALDERON: Vice President Biden...\n",
      "SANDERS: It takes courage sometimes to go do the right thing.\n",
      "BIDEN: You can argue about the past or the future. This man voted against the Brady bill five times, background checks, background checks, five times, number one.\n",
      "Number two, this man is the only -- one of the few Democrats I know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued. Talk about a special, special interest. We can sue -- we should be able to sue drug companies. We should be able to sue tobacco companies. We cannot sue the gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago. He says it was a mistake now. I'm prepared to accept he says it's a mistake. The question is, what do we do from this point on?\n",
      "And by the way, I might add, I'm the first person to go on national television in any administration and say I supported gay marriage. I supported gay marriage when asked. And I -- so -- and it started a ripple effect. I'm not taking all credit for it, but I'm the first major player to say I support gay marriage on national television.\n",
      "SANDERS: All that I'm saying here is...\n",
      "BIDEN: Leadership.\n",
      "SANDERS: ... we can argue, you know, this or that bill. But what I'm suggesting is that, in this time of crisis, when we're living in a really, really unsettling world, economically, from a health care with the coronavirus, the people of America know my record, OK? For  years, I have stood with the working families of this country. I have taken on every special interest there is out there. And that is what I will do in the White House. That's a very different record than Joes.\n",
      "BIDEN: That is not a different record than mine.\n",
      "SANDERS: That is a totally different record than yours, all right? I mean, it's manifested in this campaign when you're, you know, getting all this money from, you know, wealthy people and billionaires. So I think if -- if you want somebody who will take to the White House what I have done for my whole life...\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n",
      "SANDERS: ... and that is take on special interests, I think I'm that candidate.\n",
      "BIDEN: The average campaign contribution, $ dollars.\n",
      "TAPPER: Let's talk about the future, Vice President Biden. If you become the Democratic presidential nominee, how will you appeal to supporters of Senator Sanders when you do disagree on so many issues?\n",
      "BIDEN: He's making it hard for me right now. I was trying to give him credit for some things. He won't even take the credit for things he wants to do.\n",
      "Look, I think that -- I want to make it clear. If Bernie is the nominee, I will not only support him, I will campaign for him. And I believe the people who support me will do the same thing, because the existential threat to the United States of America is Donald Trump. It's critical. I would hope that Bernie would do the same thing if I'm the nominee and encourage all of his followers to, in fact, support me, as well, because it's much bigger than either of us.\n",
      "Character of the nation is on the ballot. It goes well beyond whether or not -- Senator Sanders and I both agree we need Medicare -- health care should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to give -- deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we deal -- we have a new green deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity.\n",
      "We disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything. This is a man who wants to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, not -- not Bernie, the president of the United States.\n",
      "So this is much bigger than whether or not I'm the nominee or Bernie is the nominee. We must defeat Donald Trump. He is the -- four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a nation. We've got to restore this country's soul. That's essential. And as long as this president is there, we're not going to be able to do it.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders, if..\n",
      "SANDERS: Can I just say a word, then I'll respond to your...\n",
      "TAPPER: Well, it's just a quick question, which is, if he is the nominee, Vice President Biden, you've already said you would support him.\n",
      "SANDERS: Of course.\n",
      "TAPPER: But will you campaign for him?\n",
      "SANDERS: Sure.\n",
      "TAPPER: Will you urge supporters to support him?\n",
      "SANDERS: Look, on day one, when I announced my candidacy, what I said is this country cannot deal with a president who is a pathological liar, who is running a corrupt administration and obviously doesn't know the Constitution of the United States, who believes is above the law, who is a racist and a sexist and a homophone. He is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.\n",
      "And what I said on day one, Joe, day one, that obviously I hope to win the nomination, but if I don't win the nomination, I -- and I think every over Democratic candidate -- is prepared to come together to do everything humanly possible to defeat Donald Trump.\n",
      "But let me respond to something that Joe said. You know, we talk about the Green New Deal and all of these things in general terms, but details make a difference. What I have said throughout this campaign -- and I don't think I've heard you say this, Joe, is that if we're going to -- if we're going to save this planet for our kids and future generations, we need to have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry and make it clear to them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And we have a very detailed planet -- detailed proposal. Happy to get the endorsement of the Sunrise Movement, the young people...\n",
      "TAPPER: We're -- we're going to get into the Green New Deal.\n",
      "SANDERS: OK.\n",
      "TAPPER: We're going to talk about climate change. We have to squeeze in a quick break. When we come back, the CNN-Univision presidential debate will return. Stay with us.\n",
      "[commercial break]\n",
      "BASH: Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate, live from Washington, D.C. And as we noted, Arizona will vote on Tuesday. We solicited questions from undecided Democratic voters there. One is from Amy Langenfeld, who is a law professor from Chandler, Arizona, with a question for Senator Sanders.\n",
      "QUESTION: Women are the canaries in the coalmine of the conservative agenda. Our access to health care is at risk from the Federalist Society's remaking of the courts. Our lives are threatened by abusive partners' access to guns. Women are disproportionately affected by bail requirements, Social Security cuts, and cuts to public education. How will your cabinet ensure the best advice on issues that affect women's physical and financial health? Thank you.\n",
      "SANDERS: My cabinet, my administration will look like America. Last I heard, over half of the people in America are women. And that will be the representation in my cabinet and my administration.\n",
      "And in terms of policies, unlike Joe, I have consistently believed and have a  percent lifetime voting record from groups like NARAL, that it is a woman's right to control her own body, not the government.\n",
      "I have believed that we have got to move aggressively to deal with domestic violence in this country. I have aggressively -- and I think effectively -- made the case that we cannot have women in America earning  cents on the dollar compared to men. And if you're a minority woman, it's  or  cents on the dollar.\n",
      "We need to have universal, affordable, high-quality childcare, so women who are single or married can go off to work and know that their kids are going to be well taken care of. So I think if you look at my agenda, which is on berniesanders.com, what you will find, it is a very strong agenda in fighting for the rights of women who today are under incredible political assault by Trump and Republican governors all across this country.\n",
      "BASH: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Am I able to respond to that?\n",
      "BASH: Please.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, thank you. Number one, I agree with -- with the question of the -- the underlying premise of Amy's question. Number one, I committed that if I'm elected president, have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, will be -- I'll appoint the first black woman to the courts. It's required that they have representation now. It's long overdue.\n",
      "Secondly, if I'm elected president, my -- my cabinet, my administration will look like the country. And I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a -- I'll pick a woman to be vice president. There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.\n",
      "Number three, I'm the guy that wrote the domestic violence law. And I'm the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun, period. They should not be able to own a gun. I would get the boyfriend exception amended now. I've gotten it passed that if you are -- got a stay away order from a court, you have a child with someone, that you cannot own a gun. No one should be able to own a gun who has abused a woman, period.\n",
      "BASH: Mr. Vice President, if I could just follow up, just to be clear, you just committed here tonight that your running mate, if you get the nomination, will be a woman?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me...\n",
      "BASH: Senator Sanders, will you make that same statement?\n",
      "SANDERS: May I just respond and ask Joe a question?\n",
      "BASH: Please.\n",
      "SANDERS: Right now, a woman's right to control her own body is under massive assault, unpredictable assault.\n",
      "BIDEN: It is.\n",
      "SANDERS: Joe, you have in the past on more than one occasion voted for the Hyde amendment, which says that a woman, low-income woman, could not use Medicaid funding for an abortion. Is that still your view?\n",
      "BIDEN: It's not my view. And by the way, everybody who has been in the Congress voted for the Hyde Amendment at one point or another because it was locked in other bills.\n",
      "The reason why I affirmatively came out opposed to the Hyde Amendment was that if we're going to have public funding for all health care along the line, there's no way you could allow for there to be a requirement that you have Hyde Amendment, a woman who doesn't have the money could not have coverage under health care.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I'm glad...\n",
      "BIDEN: Number two -- and I've done that -- I did that a while ago, OK? Number one.\n",
      "Number two, I would send immediately to the desk of the United States Congress, when I'm elected president -- if I'm elected president, a codification of Roe v. Wade amended by Casey, because I think it is a woman's right to choose. I think it's a woman's opportunity to be able to make that decision. And, in fact, I have gotten  percent rating from NARAL as well.\n",
      "BASH: Senator Sanders, before we move on, I just want to get you to respond.\n",
      "SANDERS: Excuse me, you have a lifetime  percent voting record from NARAL?\n",
      "BIDEN: I know my record of late from NARAL has been  percent. I don't know whether it was  years ago.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, all right. I mean, I think one of the differences, not to, you know, pick a bone here, is I have been consistent. All right? I have always believed in that. And you have not. I'm glad you have changed your views.\n",
      "BASH: Senator, just to be clear, the vice president committed to picking a woman as his running mate. If you get the nomination, will you?\n",
      "SANDERS: In all likelihood, I will. For me, it's not just nominating a woman, it is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction.\n",
      "CALDERON: Let's turn now to immigration. Vice President Biden, you have recently said for the first time that the Obama-Biden administration made a big mistake in deporting millions of immigrants, but you didn't publicly speak out against it at the time. What commitment will you make tonight that as president you won't deport millions again?\n",
      "BIDEN: Number one, I said that it took much too long to get it right. And the president did get it right by DACA as well as making sure that he tried to protect parents as well, and, by the way, moving on an immigration bill as well. The fact is that we already had a vote on an immigration bill, by the way, and Bernie voted against it, the immigration bill. Had he voted for it and it had passed, we would already have  million undocumented would be citizens as I speak right now.\n",
      "But I will send to the desk immediately a bill that requires the access to citizenship for  million undocumented folks, number one. Number two, in the first  days of my administration, no one, no one will be deported at all. From that point on, the only deportations that will take place are commissions of felonies in the United States of America.\n",
      "CALDERON: So to be clear, only felons get deported and everyone else gets to stay?\n",
      "BIDEN: Period, yes. Yes, and the reason is...\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "BIDEN: ... it's about uniting families, it's about making sure that we can both be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation that is decent.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me respond and I'll answer your question, respond to what Joe's comments about the  immigration bill. That bill was opposed by LULAC, the largest Latino organization in America. The Southern Poverty Law Center called its guest worker programs akin to slavery.\n",
      "There wasn't really a vote on the bill. It was killed because there was a vote on the Doggett Amendment, I think it was -, and you know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama. He understood that that proposal was a bad idea. We don't need slavery in America where workers -- guest workers are forced to stay with their employers.\n",
      "But in terms of immigration in general, let me outline some of the things that we do. Day one, we restore the legal status of . million young people and their parents in the DACA program. Number two, immediately, we end these ICE raids which are terrorizing communities all over this country. Three, we change the border policy. Under my administration, no federal agent will ever grab little babies from the arms of their mothers. And, fourth, I think we can pass what the American people want and that is comprehensive immigration reform, a path towards citizenship for the  million undocumented.\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders, critics suggest positions like this send a message that when a Democrat is in the White House, the border is open. Do they?\n",
      "SANDERS: No, that's just -- I mean, that's what Trump says. And that is a total lie. What we're talking about is a humane, sensible policy supported by the American people. Nobody is talking about open borders. And, of course, Trump lies a about that.\n",
      "But the bottom line is right now you have in this country people who have been here for decades. They are working hard. They are raising their kids. They are an important part of our agricultural economy, our construction economy. These are good people. And yet they are living in terror. And we have got to end that terror and end the ICE raids and move toward a path towards citizenship.\n",
      "BIDEN: Let me set the record straight on something that was said. You know, the idea that it was slavery, Barack Obama supported that bill -- that immigration bill. Teddy Kennedy supported that immigration bill. I supported it. I doubt whether those people think it's slavery.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well...\n",
      "BIDEN: And by the way, right after his vote against that, he went on the Lou Dobbs show and continued the canard that they're taking jobs, these immigrants are taking jobs from Americans, which is one of the Republican canards, right after that vote -- that no vote.\n",
      "And so, come on, this is -- you think Ted Kennedy is for slavery? Think I was for slavery? You think...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "BIDEN: ... voted for it for slavery? And with regard to your issue -- your question relative to whether or not I would deal with supporting the border. Look, we can deal with securing the border by national technical means. All the bad things are coming through ports of entry right now. We don't need a wall.\n",
      "And by the way, I would immediately as president surge to the border. I would end this notion for the first time in history that people seeking asylum have to be in squalor on the other side of the river, and in just desperate situation. They should be able to come to the United States and have a judgment made as to whether or not they qualify.\n",
      "I would also surge to the border immigration judges to make decisions immediately. And no one, no one would be put in jail while waiting for their hearing.\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, it's kind of what I have been saying throughout the entire campaign.\n",
      "BIDEN: So have I.\n",
      "SANDERS: What we need is, at the border, hundreds of administrative judges. We need to deal with people who are seeking asylum based on international law. We need not to be dividing children from their parents and dividing families up. We need a humane border policy.\n",
      "And I'll tell you what else we need. And I speak as the son of an immigrant. My father came to this country from Poland at the age of  without a nickel in his pocket, couldn't speak English, didn't have much of an education. I will end on day one the demonization, the ugly demonization from the White House of the immigrant community in this country. We have got a president who is trying to divide us up. My administration brings our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian-American.\n",
      "CALDERON: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, you opposed sanctuary cities as a presidential candidate in . Where do you stand now? Should undocumented immigrants, arrested by local police, be turned over to immigration officials?\n",
      "BIDEN: No.\n",
      "CALDERON: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Of course not. Look, and one of the things that goes on when you have that process is that not only the psychological terror, and I have talked to these kids, kids are scared to death in America when they come from school that their mom or dad may not be there, maybe deported.\n",
      "What we need to do is to end, and I will end this on day one, the ICE raids that have been so harmful to so many people. And we need to do again what the American people want us to do. I'm the son of an immigrant. This is a country significantly built by immigrant labor, built by slave labor. And what we have got to do is appreciate each other and end this demonization and divisiveness coming from the Trump administration.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "TAPPER: Go ahead.\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, we are a nation of immigrants. Our future rests upon the Latino community being fully integrated. Twenty-four out of every  children in school today from kindergarten through high school is a Latino. Right now, today. The idea that any American thinks it doesn't pay for us to significantly invest in their future is absolutely a bizarre notion, because if we do not invest, everything that the very wealthy are concerned about and the xenophobes are concerned about will, in fact, get worse, not better.\n",
      "We should be embracing, bringing them in, just like what happened with the Irish immigrants after the famine, just what happened with the Italians, et cetera. We have been through this before. Xenophobia is a disease.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Vice President Biden.\n",
      "Let's move now to the climate crisis. I'm coming right to you, Senator Sanders. The World Health Organization calls the climate crisis a \"health crisis\" and warns that climate change could fuel the spread of infectious diseases. Can you point to specific measures in your climate plan that address that threat?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, of course we do. I mean, we -- look, this is what the scientists are telling us, the same scientists who make your point there, Jake. What they are telling us is if we don't get our act together in the next seven or eight years, there would be irreversible damage done to this planet. We're talking about cities in America from Miami to New Orleans to Charleston, South Carolina, being under water.\n",
      "We are talking about severe droughts, which will prevent farmers in the Midwest from growing the food that we need. We're talking about extreme weather disturbances, which hit Houston, Texas, Venice, Italy, just a few months ago. We are talking about the absolute need, and I want to hear Joe's position on this, this is not a middle of the ground thing. This is not building a few more solar panels or a few more wind turbines.\n",
      "What this is about is transforming our energy system as quickly as we humanly can away from fossil fuel. It is insane that we continue to have fracking in America. It is absurd that we give tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. This has got to end and end now if we love our kids and future generations.\n",
      "TAPPER: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: First thing that President Obama and I were summoned to the State Department -- excuse me, the Defense Department for was to meet with all the chiefs. The single greatest threat to our national security, they said, is climate change, the single greatest threat to our national security. Because as populations have to move because they can no longer live where they are, because their islands are sinking, because you saw what happened in Darfur with the change in weather patterns and the desert there. It causes war. It causes great migrations, great migrations. They said that's the single biggest problem.\n",
      "Number two, there's an awful lot of people today who are, in fact, getting ill because of the changes in the environment, particularly up where Bernie lives, I'm not -- it has nothing to do with him, but having -- up in the Northeast because you have everything from beetle infestation and a whole range of things that are causing diseases as well in addition to eliminating foliage.\n",
      "TAPPER: So, Vice President Biden, let me ask you then that the -- you talk about this being the number one crisis, they told you at the Pentagon.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes.\n",
      "TAPPER: The price tag for your climate plan is about $. trillion. That's about $ trillion less than Senator Sanders wants to spend on this. Is your plan ambitious enough to tackle this crisis?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, it is ambitious enough to tackle the crisis because what -- you go to joebiden.com, I lay out the first  things I would do immediately upon being elected.\n",
      "Number one, we're going to once again reinstate all the cuts the president made in everything from the CAFE standards, how far automobiles can go, investing in light rail so that we take cars off the road, making sure we're in a position where we are now in a position that we put , charging stations in areas that, in fact, all new highways that we built.\n",
      "Making sure that we spend $ billion a year in the federal government paying for transportation, the vehicles we run. All of those being converted to be able to run on low carbon fuel and/or be able to run on no carbon fuel at all by having them move into a direction that is all, all carbon-free.\n",
      "We can do these things. We can lay down the tracks where nothing can be changed by the next president or following president, the one beyond that.\n",
      "In addition to that, we also have to -- I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, which I helped put together. I would call the  nations -- over  nations, but the  major polluters to the United States in the first  days to up the ante and make it clear that, in fact, we would -- in fact, if they didn't, there would be a price to pay.\n",
      "And lastly, I would be right now organizing the hemisphere and the world to provide $ billion for the Amazon, for Brazil no longer to burn the Amazon so they could have forests -- they're no longer forests, but they could have farming, and say, this is what we're going to do. They absorb more carbon in the Amazon, and the region is burning now, than we emit in one entire year per year.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: All well and good, but nowhere near enough. I mean, you mentioned we started this debate talking about a war-like situation in terms of the coronavirus. And we said we have to act accordingly. You said it. I think you're right. I said it. We have to act dramatically, boldly, if we're going to save lives in this country and around the world.\n",
      "I look at climate change in exactly the same way. It's not a question of re-entering the Paris Accord. That's fine. Who cares. Not a big deal. The deal right now is do we have the courage? And this gets back to the point I'm trying to make all night long. Do we take on the health care industry and tell them their profits are not more important than health care for all? Do we take on the fossil fuel industry?\n",
      "Look, in terms of the fossil fuel industry, these guys have been lying. They've been lying for years like the tobacco industry lied  years ago. \"Oh, we don't know if -- if fossil fuels, if oil and carbon emissions are causing climate change.\"\n",
      "They knew. Exxon Mobil knew. They lied. In fact, I think they should be held criminally accountable.\n",
      "But this, Jake, is an issue of enormous consequence. What Joe was saying goes nowhere near enough. It's not a question of money.\n",
      "Give me a minute here. Let's -- we have time to talk about this. This is a world-changing event.\n",
      "TAPPER: I understand. I just want to give him a chance to respond and then we can come back to you.\n",
      "SANDERS: OK. All right. Let's stay on it.\n",
      "TAPPER: We're staying on this issue.\n",
      "BIDEN: Number one, no more subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one.\n",
      "Number two, we're in a situation, as well, where we cannot -- we -- we are able to move rapidly to change the dynamic in terms of what we can do to set in motion -- the fact that he says climate change, Paris Accord doesn't mean much -- we can get everything exactly right. We're  percent of the problem. Eight-five percent of the problem is over there. We need someone who can deal internationally. We need someone who can bring the world together again. We need someone who can move in a direction that, in fact, if you violate the commitment you make, you will pay an economic price for it, like what's happening in China. They're exporting coal, significant coal.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you.\n",
      "SANDERS: OK, look, obviously, the Paris Accord is -- is useful. But it doesn't go anywhere -- if you're laughing, Joe, then you're missing the point. This is an existential crisis.\n",
      "BIDEN: Bingo.\n",
      "SANDERS: You -- you -- you talk about -- you know, I'm talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can. I'm talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet -- no ifs, buts and maybes about it. I'm talking about speaking to...\n",

      "I'm talking about speaking to China, to Russia, to countries all over the world -- and in this moment, making the point that instead of spending $. trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.\n",
      "I know your heart is in the right place, but this requires dramatic, bold action. We've got to take on the fossil fuel industry. Your plan does not do that.\n",
      "BIDEN: My plan takes on the fossil fuel industry and it unites the world. You just got finished saying -- what's he going to do? He's going to bring these countries together, make it clear to them. I'm saying we bring them together, make them live up to their commitments. If they don't live up to their commitments, they pay a financial price for it. They pay an economic price for it.\n",
      "Because we can do everything -- my -- my state is three feet above sea level. I don't need a lecture on what's going to happen about rising seas. I know what happens. I watch the whole DelMarVa peninsula, just like it is in South Carolina and the rest, something I know a little bit about.\n",
      "I wrote the first climate change bill that was in the Congress, which Politifact said was a game-changer. I'm the guy who came along and said, with Dick Lugar, that we're going to trade -- we'll forgive your debt if you don't cut down your forest. I have been way ahead of this curve. This idea that, all of a sudden, Bernie found this out is amazing to me.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: No, Bernie didn't find it out. Bernie is listening to the scientists. And what, you know, you're talking about making countries around the world fulfill their commitments, those commitments are not enough.\n",
      "What this moment is about, Joe, is that the scientists are telling us they underestimated the severity of the crisis. They were wrong. The problem is more severe.\n",
      "So all that I'm saying right here is that we have -- we are fighting for the future of this planet, for the well-being of our kids and future generations. You cannot continue, as I understand, Joe believes, to continue fracking. Correct me if I am wrong. What we need to do right now is bring the world together, tell the fossil fuel industry that we are going to move aggressively to win solar, sustainable energies...\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you.\n",
      "SANDERS: ... and energy efficiency.\n",
      "BIDEN: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "BIDEN: No more -- no new fracking. And by the way, on the Recovery Act, I was able to make sure we invested $ billion in making sure we brought down the price of solar and wind, that is lower than the price of coal. That's why not another new coal plant will be built. I did that, while you were watching, number one.\n",
      "Number two, we're in a situation where we, in fact, have the ability to lay down the tracks where no one can change the -- change the dynamic. And that's why we should be talking about things like I have been talking about for years, high-speed rail, taking millions of automobiles off the road, making sure that we move in a direction where no more -- no more drilling on federal lands, making sure that we invest in changing the entire fleet...\n",

      "TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n",

      "SANDERS: Yes.\n",
      "TAPPER: ... which is a method of extracting natural gas. The shift towards natural gas and away from coal has resulted in reduced U.S. carbon emissions. So how can the U.S. transition to your targeted goal of zero emissions with fracking completely out of the picture?\n",
      "SANDERS: Because we have to invest in an unprecedented way -- in an unprecedented way. You started off by saying that we're talking about a $ trillion, $ trillion investment. That is a lot of money. And I've been criticized for that. But I don't know what the alternative is, if we are playing for the future of this planet. So we've got to be dramatic. And what being dramatic is, massive investments in wind, in solar, under the -- in sustainable energies in general, in research and development, in making our buildings all over this country.\n",
      "My state of Vermont and around this country have got a lot of old buildings. We can put millions and millions of people to work making our buildings energy-efficient, moving our transportation system to electricity.\n",
      "So what we're talking about is a massive unprecedented investment. That is what the Green New Deal is about. I supported it. And I will fight to implement it.\n",

      "TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate. On Tuesday voters in Arizona, Ohio, Illinois and Florida will cast their votes in the Democratic primary.\n",
      "Here's Univision's Ilia Calderon.\n",
      "CALDERON: Thank you, Jake.\n",
      "Let's move now to foreign policy. Senator Sanders, there are about . million Cuban-Americans living in Florida right now. Why would they vote for you when they hear you praise a program of Fidel Castro, a dictator who jailed, tortured and killed thousands of Cubans?\n",
      "SANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism, whether it's in Cuba, whether it's in Saudi Arabia, whether it's in China or whether it is in Russia. That is my life record. I believe, unlike the president of the United States, in democracy, not authoritarianism, in Cuba or any place else.\n",
      "What I believe right now, in this world, is that we are faced with a global crisis and a movement toward authoritarianism. That's what Putin in Russia is leading. That's what MBS in Saudi Arabia is leading.\n",
      "And as president of the United States, unlike Donald Trump, I would put the flag down and say that, in this country and in this world, we have got to move toward democracy and human rights. That is my view and has always been my view.\n",
      "CALDERON: To be clear, Senator Sanders, Cuba has been a dictatorship for decades. Shouldn't we judge dictators by the violation of human rights and not by any of their alleged achievements?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I think you can make the same point about China. China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society, OK. But would anybody deny, any economist deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was  or  years ago? That's a fact. So I think we condemn authoritarianism, whether it's in China, Russia, Cuba, any place else. But to simply say that nothing ever done by any of those administrations had a positive impact on their people would, I think, be incorrect.\n",
      "BIDEN: Vice President Biden, you have criticized Senator Sanders for praising Castro's education system. But in  President Obama said Cuba made, quote, \"a great progress in educating young people\" and that its health care system \"is a huge achievement that they should be congratulated for.\"\n",
      "How is that different from what Senator Sanders has said?\n",
      "BIDEN: He was trying to change Cuban policy so the Cuban people would get out from under the thumb of Castro and his brother, that is to change the policy so that we could in fact on -- impact on Cuba's policy by getting them opened up. That's what that was about.\n",
      "But the praising of the Sandinistas, the praising of Cuba, the praising, just now, of China -- China is an authoritarian dictatorship. That's what it is. We have to deal with them because they're there. But the idea that they, in fact, have increased the wealth of people in that country -- it's been marginal, the change that's taken place. It is still -- they have a million Uighurs, a million Muslims in prison camps in the West. You see what's happening in Hong Kong today.\n",
      "And by the way, the idea that he praised the Soviet Union, when it was the Soviet Union, about the things that they had done well -- they're an awful dictatorship killing millions and millions of people.\n",
      "And in addition to that, we have a circumstance where, after the election was all over and we knew what -- what was done by -- by the Russians now, in interfering with our elections, this man voted against sanctioning Russia for interference in our elections.\n",
      "BASH: Senator Sanders...\n",
      "BIDEN: I don't get it.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, what you don't get -- and this is exactly what the problem with politics is about. All right, question. Did China make progress in ending extreme poverty over the last  years, yes or no?\n",
      "BIDEN: That's like saying Jack the Ripper...\n",
      "SANDERS: No, it's not.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, it is.\n",
      "SANDERS: See, Joe, this is the problem.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, it is.\n",
      "SANDERS: This is the problem. We can't talk -- I know there's a political line. I understand. China's terrible and awful, nothing ever good, [inaudible]. But the fact of the matter is China, of course, is an authoritarian society. It's what I just said.\n",
      "BIDEN: It's a dictatorship.\n",
      "SANDERS: That's what I just said five minutes ago, you know. And, by the way, you know, the question that was asked quoted Barack Obama. President Obama was more generous in his praise of what Cuba did in health care and education than I was. I was talking about a program  years ago, in the first year of the Castro revolution.\n",
      "So the bottom line is that I think it's a little bit absurd -- if we're going to look at the world the way it is, of course, we are opposed to authoritarianism. And by the way, you know, before it was considered good policy, a good idea. I was condemning the dictatorship in Saudi Arabia when a lot of other people in Washington...\n",
      "BIDEN: It wasn't me.\n",
      "SANDERS: I was condemning the dictatorship in the UAE. You were not.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, I was.\n",
      "CALDERON: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n",
      "Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, the idea of occasionally saying something nice about a country is one thing. The idea of praising a country that is violating human rights around the world is, in fact -- makes our allies wonder what's going on.\n",
      "What do you think the South Koreans think when we -- or he praises China like that?\n",
      "What do you think -- what do you think the Australians believe in the shadow of China?\n",
      "What do you think is happening in Indonesia in the shadow of China?\n",
      "What do you think is happening in terms of Japan in the shadow of China?\n",
      "Words matter. These are flat-out dictators, period. And they should be called for it, straight up. We may have to work out -- for example, I was able to help negotiate a New START agreement with Russia, not because I like Putin. The guy's a thug.\n",
      "TAPPER: Mr. Vice President, sticking with foreign policy, you acknowledge that your support and vote for the Iraq War was a mistake. What lessons did you learn from that mistake?\n",
      "And how might those lessons influence your foreign policy decision-making as president?\n",
      "BIDEN: I learned I can't take the word of a president when, in fact, they assured me that they would not use force. Remember the context. The context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors in to determine whether or not -- whether or not they were in fact producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction.\n",
      "They were not. And what's the first thing that happened when we got elected?\n",
      "President Obama turned to me and said, \"Get those troops out of there.\"\n",
      "I was responsible for getting , combat troops out of Iraq. I was -- I admitted  years ago it was a mistake to have trusted him. And I'm prepared to compare my foreign policy credentials up against my friend here on any day of the week and every day of the week.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, let's start off with the war in Iraq, Joe. I was there, too. I was in the House. I understood -- and, by the way, let's be clear about what that vote was. And you were there at the signing ceremony with Bush. Everybody in the world knew that, when you voted for that resolution, you were giving Bush the authority to go to war. And everybody knew that's exactly what he and Cheney wanted to do.\n",
      "Most people who followed that issue closely understood that the Bush administration was lying through its teeth with regard to Saddam having weapons of mass destruction. I understood that. I was on the floor of the House time and time again.\n",
      "But the issue is not just the war in Iraq. That was a long time ago. The issue is the trade agreement. It wasn't so easy for me to lead the effort against disastrous trade agreements. The issue was the bankruptcy bill that you supported. The issue was the Hyde amendment. The issue was the Defense of Marriage Act. The issue is whether or not, in difficult times, and God knows these are difficult times, we're going to have the courage to take on powerful special interests and do what's right...\n",
      "TAPPER: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "SANDERS: ... for working families in this country.\n",
      "BIDEN: Why did you vote not to sanction the Russians?\n",
      "SANDERS: I'll tell you. You know why? Because that -- you keep talking about Iran. That was tied to Iran. Russia was in Iran. I think John Kerry indicated his support for what I did. That was undermining the Iranian agreement. That's why.\n",
      "BIDEN: That's not true. Our...\n",
      "SANDERS: That's why, and that's the only reason why.\n",
      "BIDEN: That is not...\n",
      "SANDERS: I have condemned Russia time and time again.\n",
      "TAPPER: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: The fact is that -- the idea that I, in fact, supported the things that he's suggesting is not accurate. Look, I'm the guy that helped put together the Iran deal and got the inspectors in there. That was my -- my chief of staff was the guy, my foreign policy guy, doing that negotiation.\n",
      "I was the guy that helped put together a -nation organization to take on the ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. I've dealt with these folks. I know them. And I know what they're like. And I know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are.\n",
      "The fact is this -- Bernie's notion about how he embraces folks like the Sandinistas and Cuba and the former Soviet Union and talks about the good things in China, it's absolutely contrary to every message we want to send the rest of the world.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: I have led the effort against all forms of authoritarianism, including America's so-called allies in the UAE and in Saudi Arabia, and in fact, as you may know, work with conservative Republicans to utilize for the very first time the War Powers Act to get the United States out of the horrific war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia. That's what I did. So my view is that in a world moving toward authoritarianism, the United States has got to be the leader where people all over the world look to us for guidance.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, gentlemen. I want to change topics and ask each of you about some of your vulnerabilities in this election, starting with you, Vice President Biden. Senator Sanders has won more of the Hispanic vote than you in several key states so far. In fact, he doubled your support in California among Hispanics. He almost tripled it in Nevada. So why is your message not resonating with Hispanic voters?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, look, my message is resonating across the board. Every single state we've been in, there's been a significant turnout. In Virginia, turnout was up  percent. They voted for me. He didn't bring them out. I brought them out.\n",
      "And, number two, look what's happened in Mississippi. Look what's happened in North Carolina. Look what's happened in Washington state. Look what's happened across the board. Why is it that I'm I winning all those places? What's the reason? What's the reason?\n",
      "The reason is because they know I am a Democrat with a capital \"D\" who, in fact, believes that our base is the base of the Democratic Party, which are hard-working men and women, who, in fact, are high school educated, African-Americans and minorities, including Hispanics, but all minorities, suburban women, people who, in fact, have a sense of our place in the world. That's why I am winning -- not just winning, but overwhelmingly winning. Not even close in these places. And...\n",
      "BASH: Senator...\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, you didn't quite win...\n",
      "BASH: Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, let me just follow up with you about an issue that you're having. For the second consecutive presidential election, you're struggling to gain wide support from African-Americans. Why is your message not resonating with African-American voters?\n",
      "SANDERS: Here is what I believe is happening. And this is an important point and why I decided to run for president. I think it's imperative that we defeat Trump. I think our campaign, of a biracial, bi-generational, multigenerational, grassroots movement is the way to do it.\n",
      "Now, we have won some states. Joe has won more states than I have. But here's what we are winning. We are winning the ideological struggle. Even states in Mississippi, where Joe won a major victory, it turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for all. And that's true in almost every state in this country.\n",
      "And the other issue that we don't talk enough about is we are winning the generational struggle. Depending on the state, we're winning people  years of age or younger. Big time, people  years of age and younger. I, frankly, have my doubts.\n",
      "Look, I -- if I lose this thing, Joe wins, Joe, I will be there for you. But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump -- who will be a very, very tough opponent -- unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history.\n",
      "And to do that, you are going to have to bring young people, who are not great voters. They don't vote in the kinds of numbers they should -- into the political process. You're going to have to bring Latinos, who are great people, who have the agenda that we need, but also don't vote in the numbers that we need. I have my doubts that Vice President Biden's campaign can generate that energy and excitement and that voter turnout.\n",
      "BIDEN: I will do that. And by the way, just get this straight. The energy and excitement that's taken place so far has been for me,  percent turnout increase in Virginia. I can go down the list. They are coming out for me. And I didn't even have the money to compete with this man in those states. I virtually had no money. The press kept saying, Biden has no money. And they were right. Biden had no money.\n",
      "And the idea, why are they doing that? The reason they're doing that is because they understand I know what has to happen, that I know what needs to be done. And by the way, the idea that everybody supports Medicare for all, he still hasn't indicated how much it's going to cost people. He's yet to know exactly what's going to -- so here's my point. People don't know the detail at all. And the fact is...\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, sir.\n",
      "BIDEN: ... I am winning overwhelmingly among Democratic constituencies across the board.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We're going to be right back with more from the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate. Stay right there.\n",
      "[commercial break]\n",
      "TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN-Univision Democratic presidential debate.\n",
      "Finally, gentlemen, thanks so much for everything. As we end here tonight, let's return to where we began, the coronavirus, which does not discriminate based on ideology, it does not care if one is a Democrat or a Republican, a conservative, a moderate or a progressive.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, let me start with you. What's your closing message tonight for those who are concerned about, affected by, or dealing with the coronavirus?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, our hearts go out to everyone. We need to move aggressively to make sure that every person in this country who has the virus, who thinks they have the virus, understands they get all the health care that they need, because they are Americans, that we move aggressively to make sure that the test kits are out there, that the ventilators are out there, that the ICU units are out there, that the medical personnel are out there.\n",
      "But, Jake, if I might also say, that in this moment of economic uncertainty, in addition to the coronavirus, it is time to ask how we get to where we are, not only our lack of preparation for the virus, but how we end up with an economy where so many of our people are hurting at a time of massive income and wealth inequality. It is time to ask this -- the question of where the power is in America.\n",
      "Who owns the media? Who owns the economy? Who owns the legislative process? Why do we give tax breaks to billionaires and not raise the minimum wage? Why do we pump up the oil industry while a half-a-million people are homeless in America?\n",
      "This is a time to move aggressively, dealing with the coronavirus crisis, to deal with the economic fallout. But it's also a time to rethink America and create a country where we care about each other rather than a nation of greed and corruption, which is what is taking place among the corporate elite.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, what's your closing message tonight for those concerned about, affected by, or dealing with this virus?\n",
      "BIDEN: Number one, as I said at the outset, I just can't imagine what people are going through right now who have lost someone already. I can't imagine what people are going through, when they have a mom -- for example, a good friend of ours is sitting outside the window of a nursing home where her mom is because she can't go in, trying to do sign language to her mom through the window to be able to talk to her. I can't imagine the fear and the -- I guess I can imagine the fear and concern people have.\n",
      "Number one, one of the things that I think we have to understand is that this is an all hands on deck. This is -- as someone said, maybe it was you, Jake, at the outset, this is bigger than any individual. This is bigger than yourself. This is about America. This is about the world. This is about how we bring people together and make the kind of sacrifices we need to make to get this done.\n",
      "And so, first and foremost, what we have to do is start to listen to the science again. As I said, what we did, we met -- what I'd be doing today, I'd be sitting down in the Situation Room literally every day, like we did at the outset of other crises we had when we were in the White House, and pulling together the best people, and not just in the United States, the world, and say, what is it -- what are the prescriptive moves we have to take now to lessen this virus, to beat it, to go to the point where we can save more lives, get more people tested, get more people the kind of care they need?\n",
      "And then what do we do beyond that, to make sure that the economic impact on them is, in fact, rendered harmless, that we, in fact, make sure every paycheck is met, every paycheck that's out there, that the people are going to miss, that we keep people in their homes, that they don't miss their mortgage payments, they don't miss their rent payments, making sure that they're going to be able to take care of education, that they're -- and, by the way, the education systems are closing down right now.\n",
      "And so there are so many things we have to do. And in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to have the best science in the world telling what can stay open and what need be closed. Like I said earlier, the idea that we're closing schools -- which I understand -- but not being able to provide lunches for people who, in fact, need the school lunch program to get by.\n",
      "The idea that we would close any place that -- I can understand the decision made to close places where  or  people or more gather. But how do you keep open the drugstore to make sure you can get your prescription? How do you deal with the things that necessarily have to be kept going? And what's the way to do that? There should be a national standard for that. It should be coming out of the Situation Room right now.\n",
      "And by the way, the single most significant thing we can do to deal with the larger problem down the road of income inequality is get rid of Donald Trump. Donald Trump, he's exacerbated every single one of these problems, both the immediate urgent need and how we're going to hold people harmless for the damage done as a consequence of this virus. It's important we do both.\n",
      "TAPPER: Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, we want to thank you both for being here tonight under these challenging and trying circumstances. We wish both of you the best.\n",

I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.\n",
      "But let me tell you, I have been working very hard. We've improved the school system for black and brown students in New York City. We've increased the jobs that are available to them. We've increased the housing that's available to them. We have programs like the...\n",

      "BLOOMBERG: No -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over  black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City.\n",
      "I was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for  years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget is under control. We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities. [applause]\n",
      "KING: Mayor Buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. Do you think the New York City's implementation of stop and frisk was racist?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.\n",
      "And I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.\n",
      "None of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. Since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do...\n",
      "O'DONNELL: Thank you, Mayor.\n",

And I know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. That's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it.\n",
      "O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.\n",
      "And to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.\n",
      "And we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting.

      "WARREN: I mean that Mayor Bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy Senator Lindsey Graham, who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg.\n",

Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. And what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. The senator has got it. And I don't know what else she wants us to do.\n",

      "I have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids.\n",
      "And now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom.\n",
      "We have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. And, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. It also means investing.\n",

So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. This is one of the first times we've talked about housing. And I put forward an extensive policy.\n",
      "I think -- when I've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live.\n",
      "So the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of the Section  backlog of applicants. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting. And I have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing.\n",
      "Secondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.\n",
      "And I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.\n",
      "So for me, it's building a coalition. And I actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done.\n",

      "GARRETT: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: Yes, she's -- I'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. You can go back and look at the record. I fought against it before ', the crisis, during ', and after that. Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that.\n",

No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.\n",

      "WHITAKER: Vice President Biden, black men earn  cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both Democratic and Republican administrations. How do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?\n",
      "BIDEN: Two ways. Number one, my entire life I've been involved with the black community. I was a public defender.\n",
      "I worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for  years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county.\n",
      "The way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from . billion to $ billion, taking $ billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth.\n",
      "Secondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $, tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live.\n",
      "And thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism.\n",

      "BRENNAN: If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you.\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.\n",
      "The other issue is we don't have enough personnel. And so that's where we get to this education plan.. And I don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy.\n",
      "We're going to have a million openings for home health care workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don't know how to fill. We're going to have over , openings for nursing assistants. We're not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses.\n",
      "So putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one- and two-year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas.\n",
      "Final thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed...\n",
      "BRENNAN: Senator, time.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that.\n",
      "BRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We're seeing hospital closures right and left. And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.\n",
      "See, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone.\n",

      "KING: I'm sorry, we're going to go to Mayor Bloomberg. We're going to change topics.\n",
      "Mayor Bloomberg, as mayor of New York, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. So if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: Well, I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. So let's get serious here.\n",
      "But I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking.\n",
      "We did ban smoking in New York City in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. And it has spread across America, across Europe, across Latin America, even into places in the Middle East and into the Far East. It has saved an enormous number of lives.\n",
      "So it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. [applause]\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: And he has defunded -- he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing. As you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be.\n",

      "BLOOMBERG: We don't have anybody to respond. I'm sorry.\n",

They came up with the internet, I mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology.\n",
      "I'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health. We're going to focus at least $ billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer. And we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment.\n",
      "We can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely. [applause]\n",

      "O'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency...[applause]... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.\n",
      "I think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.\n",
      "And the way you do that is with drug courts. The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice.\n",

      "KING: I'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on.\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before. [applause]\n",
      "Number two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it.\n",
      "But, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research. And the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains.\n",
      "Until we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. But the cat's out of the bag. So some states have it, you're not going to take it away. Get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.\n",

      "O'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you were name checked.\n",
      "SANDERS: Thank you. All right, look, you're right. We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China. And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs.\n",
      "So I do believe that, on day one, we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. That's insane. We're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country.\n",
      "What we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana. [applause]\n",
      "And I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We're going to provide help to the African-American, Latino, Native American community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market.\n",

All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.\n",
      "That means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We are not winning in Afghanistan. We are not winning in the Middle East.\n",

And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.\n",
      "We shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. We should go to war only as a last resort. Nobody argues with that.\n",

This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now.\n",

And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it.\n",

      "But I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.\n",

That's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.\n",

      "Number two, only solution here is a two-state solution. The Palestinians have to be accommodated. The real problem here is you have two groups of people, both who think God gave them the same piece of land.

      "But it's not up to us to determine what the terms of a two-state solution are. We want to be a good ally to everyone in the region. The best way to do that is to encourage the parties to get to the negotiating table themselves.\n",

We should be negotiating ourselves back into the Iran nuclear agreement. We should be working with Russia not only to stand up for the protection of our elections and call Vladimir Putin out for what he is, the ruthless dictator that takes down planes, that poisons dissidents, but that, also, at the same time, we have to acknowledge that we should be renegotiating the New START treaty and the other arms negotiations that must happen.\n",

He gave this dictator -- he's a thug -- legitimacy. We've weakened the sanctions around the world against holding us -- committing people not to trade, if anything from oil to parts -- that can deal with providing missile technology.

The city of Idlib in Syria is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The Syrian regime and Russia are targeting schools, bakeries, and hospitals. What would you do as president to push back regime and Russian forces and stop the killing of innocent civilians?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, I stand with the people of Idlib, who are being targeted, as you said, in a brutal fashion by a dictatorship that has already been so brutal for so many years.\n",
      "And this is one of the reasons we have got to change the balance of power in the region, because the president has basically vanished from the stage when it comes to even playing a role in the future there. Turkey, Russia, Iran all have so much more of a say than we do. We don't have to be invading countries to be making a difference, working with our international partners, in order to deliver peace and support those who are standing up for self-determination.\n",
      "Now, I want to come back to something -- and I promise it relates to international affairs -- because Senator Sanders asked me a question earlier. He asked the question of whether health care for everybody is a radical idea, and it's not, which is why I'm for it, very much in a different way, though.\n",
      "What is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance. And part of how you know it is, is that no industrialized country has gone that far. He and I both like to talk about Denmark, for example. But even in Denmark, they have not abolished the possibility of private insurance.\n",
      "So this is an idea that goes further than what is acceptable in Denmark the country, let alone imagining how that's going to fly in Denmark, South Carolina.\n",

      "WARREN: Look, I think that what we've got to do is we have to provide humanitarian relief. We need to work with our allies on this. But this is not a moment for military intervention. We have got to use our military only when we see a military problem that can be solved militarily. We cannot send our military in unless we have a plan to get them out.\n",
      "So, for me, this is about working with our allies. It is about standing with the people who are under enormous pressure right now. This is recognizing what Donald Trump has put us in, in a terrible box around the world.\n",

      "Number two, the South Carolina motto is this. \"While I breathe, I hope.\"\n",
      "So outside of politics, in no more than  seconds or so, what is your personal motto, your personal belief, your favorite quote that represents you?\n",
      "Mr. Steyer, the biggest misconception, and then your motto?\n",
      "STEYER: The biggest misconception about me is that somehow I'm defined by business success and money.\n",
      "KING: OK, and your motto?\n",
      "STEYER: My motto: Every day, I write a cross on my hand to remind myself to tell the truth and do what's right, no matter what.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: The biggest misconception is that I'm boring, because I'm not. [laughter]\n",
      "Then, I would say that my motto is the words of one of my political mentors, Paul Wellstone, who sadly is no longer with us. And he said that \"politics is about improving people's lives.\" And that's been my life, from when my grandpa was an iron ore miner in the unions. Politics made those mines safer. And when my dad needed treatment, it was there for him, and, in his words, he was \"pursued by grace.\" And when my mom got divorced and she didn't have a job and she went back to teaching and that gift of public service got her through. And then when our daughter was born and she couldn't swallow...\n",

      "My -- also, that everyone should be represented. Everyone -- and no one's better than me and I'm no better than anyone else. The fact is, what we should be doing -- we talked about the Supreme Court. I'm looking forward to making sure there's a black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation. [applause]\n",

Health care is a human right. We have the necessity, the moral imperative, to address the existential threat of climate change. Other countries are doing that. We don't need more people in jail, disproportionately African-American, than any other country on earth -- not a radical idea.\n",
      "The motto, the saying that -- that moves me the most is from Nelson Mandela. And Mandela said, \"Everything is impossible until it happens.\" [applause]\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think the biggest conception -- misconception is that I'm not passionate. I get that I'm kind of level, some say unflappable. I don't think you want a president who is flappable. But it's precisely because I'm so passionate about the things that are going on in this country. That I consider it important to approach all of that with discipline.\n",
      "And my disciplines are guided by the mottoes I try to live by, many of which come from scripture. And just to be clear, I would never impose my interpretation of my religion to anybody. Just as sure as I'm wearing this ring I'll never let that happen to anybody.\n",
      "But I seek to live by the teachings that say if you would be a leader, you must first be a servant. And, of course, the teaching, not unique to the Christian tradition, but a big part of it, that holds that we are to treat others as we would be treated. And when I think about everything at stake, from racial and economic justice to our stewardship of the climate, to the need to heal the sick and the need to heal this country, I seek for those teachings to order my steps as I go through this campaign and as I go through life.

      "HOLT: Good evening, everyone. I'm Lester Holt. Welcome to Las Vegas.\n",
      "Everything is on the line tonight, with just three days before the critical Nevada caucuses. Here with me on the stage tonight, NBC News political director and moderator of \"Meet the Press,\" Chuck Todd. And NBC News chief White House correspondent and MSNBC anchor Hallie Jackson. Also joining us is Telemundo senior correspondent Vanessa Hauc. And editor of the Nevada Independent Jon Ralston, who has covered Nevada politics for more than three decades.\n",
      "The rules are this tonight. Candidates will get a minute and  seconds to answer each question and  seconds for follow-ups. Now that the stage is narrowed to six candidates, we encourage each of you to directly engage with each other on the issues.\n",
      "So let's get to our first question. Since the last time you all shared the stage, Senator Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has surged into the lead nationally in the Democratic race. And there's a new person on the stage tonight, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a former Republican who spent millions of his own dollars to run in this race.\n",
      "What hasn't changed: a majority of Democratic voters still say their top priority is beating President Trump. Senator Sanders, the first question to you. Mayor Bloomberg is pitching himself as a centrist who says he's best positioned to win in November. Why is your revolution a better bet?\n",
      "SANDERS: In order to beat Donald Trump, we're going to need the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk which went after African-American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.\n",
      "What our movement is about is bringing working-class people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, around an agenda that works for all of us and not just the billionaire class. And that agenda says that maybe, just maybe, we should join the rest of the industrialized world, guarantee health care to all people as a human right, raise that minimum wage to a living wage of $ bucks an hour, and have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry, because their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet and the need to combat climate change.\n",
      "Those are some of the reasons we have the strongest campaign to defeat Donald Trump.\n",
      "WARREN: So I'd like...\n",
      "HOLT: Mayor Bloomberg, can Senator Sanders beat President Trump? And how do you want to respond to what else he said?\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump. You don't start out by saying I've got  million people I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love. That's just not a way that you go and start building the coalition that the Sanders camp thinks that they can do. I don't think there's any chance whatsoever. And if he goes and is the candidate, we will have Donald Trump for another four years. And we can't stand that.\n",
      "HOLT: Senator Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: So I'd like to talk about who we're running against, a billionaire who calls women \"fat broads\" and \"horse-faced lesbians.\" And, no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\n",
      "Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist polls like redlining and stop and frisk.\n",
      "Look, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. [applause]\n",
      "This country has worked for the rich for a long time and left everyone else in the dirt. It is time to have a president who will be on the side of working families and be willing to get out there and fight for them. That is why I am in this race, and that is how I will beat Donald Trump. [applause]\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We've got to wake up...\n",
      "HOLT: Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, what do you think the path is from this stage to the White House? What works?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I think the path is a high voter turnout. I'm the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when I led the ticket, as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters. And I've done that, as well. And I'm the only one with the receipts to have done that in Republican congressional districts over and over again.\n",
      "But I want to say this: I actually welcomed Mayor Bloomberg to the stage. I thought that he shouldn't be hiding behind his TV ads, and so I was all ready for this big day. And then I looked at the memo from his campaign staff this morning, and it said that he actually thought that three of us should get out of the way. That is what his campaign said because we should \"pave the way\" for him to become the nominee.\n",
      "You know, I have been told as a woman, as someone that maybe no one thought was still going to be standing up on this stage, but I am because of pure grit and because of the people out there, I've been told many times to wait my turn and to step aside. And I'm not going to do that now, and I'm not going to do that because a campaign memo from Mayor Bloomberg said this morning that the only way that we get a nominee is if we step aside for him.\n",
      "I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don't think you look at Donald Trump and say we need someone richer in the White House. [applause]\n",
      "HOLT: Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg, there's a lot for you to respond to there, so here's your opportunity.\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: I think we have two questions to face tonight. One is, who can beat Donald Trump? And, number two, who can do the job if they get into the White House? And I would argue that I am the candidate that can do exactly both of those things.\n",
      "I'm a New Yorker. I know how to take on an arrogant conman like Donald Trump, that comes from New York. I'm a mayor or was a mayor. I know how to run a complicated city, the biggest, most diverse city in this country.\n",
      "I'm a manager. I knew what to do after / and brought the city back stronger than ever. And I'm a philanthropist who didn't inherit his money but made his money. And I'm spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we have ever had. And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids. [applause]\n",
      "HOLT: Vice President Biden, I'll let you weigh in here.\n",
      "BIDEN: In terms of who can beat Donald Trump, NBC did a poll yesterday. It says Joe Biden is best equipped to beat Donald Trump. [applause]\n",
      "That's what your poll said. And it said that I can beat him in those toss-up states, too, those states we have to win. I'm ahead by eight points across the board. So in terms of being able to beat Donald Trump, I'm better positioned, according to your poll, than anybody else to beat Donald Trump, number one. [applause]\n",
      "Number two, the mayor makes an interesting point. The mayor says that he has a great record, that he's done these wonderful things. Well, the fact -- the fact of the matter is, he has not managed his city very, very well when he was there. He didn't get a whole lot done. He had stop and frisk, throwing close to  million young black men up against a wall. And when we came along in our administration, President Obama, and said we're going to send in a moderator to -- a mediator, stop it, he said that's unnecessary.\n",
      "So I -- we're going to get a chance to talk about the mayor's record. But in terms of who is best prepared to beat Donald Trump, look at your poll and what it says.\n",
      "HOLT: Mayor Buttigieg, you'd like to weigh in.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, we've got to wake up as a party. We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage.\n",
      "And most Americans don't see where they fit if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power.\n",
      "Let's put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle-class neighborhood, in an industrial Midwestern city. Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat. Look... [applause]\n",
      "We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better.\n",
      "HOLT: Senator -- Senator Sanders, are you polarizing?\n",
      "SANDERS: If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long-neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word. What we are trying finally to do is to give a voice to people who after  years of work are not making a nickel more than they did  years ago. We are giving a voice to people who are saying we are sick and tired of billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg seeing huge expansions of their wealth while a half-a-million people sleep out on the street tonight.\n",
      "And that's what we are saying, Pete, is maybe it's a time for the working class of this country to have a little bit of power in Washington, rather than your billionaire campaign contributors. [applause]\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: All right, look, first of all -- look, my campaign is fueled by hundreds of thousands of contributors.\n",
      "SANDERS: Including  billionaires.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Among the hundreds of thousands of contributors. And, look, we've got to unite this country to deal with these issues. You're not the only one who cares about the working class. Most Americans believe we need to empower workers. [applause]\n",
      "As a matter of fact, you're the one who is at war with the Culinary Union right here in Las Vegas. We can solve these issues...\n",
      "SANDERS: We more union support than you have ever dreamed of. We have the support of unions all across this country.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, but the vision I'm putting forward has the support of the American people. We can actually deliver health care without taking it away from anyone. We can actually empower workers and lift wages without further polarizing this country. And we can build a movement without having legions of our supporters online and in person attacking Democratic figures and union leaders alike.\n",
      "WARREN: I think it is important here...\n",
      "JACKSON: Senator Warren, I have a question for you. On Sunday, on \"Meet the Press,\" Vice President Biden accused Senator Sanders' supporters of bullying union leaders here with, quote, \"vicious, malicious, misogynistic things.\" You said Democrats cannot build an inclusive party on a foundation of hate. Are Senator Sanders and his supporters making it harder for Democrats to unify in November?\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I have said many times before, we are all responsible for our supporters. And we need to step up. That's what leadership is all about.\n",
      "But the way we are going to lead this country and beat Donald Trump is going to be with a candidate who has rock-solid values and who actually gets something done. When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African-Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of , I was right here in Las Vegas, literally just a few blocks down the street, holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families.\n",
      "That's when I met Mr. Estrada, one of your neighbors. He came in to testify, and he said he thought he'd done everything right with Wells Fargo, but what had happened? They took away his house in a matter of weeks. This man stood there and cried while he talked about what it was like to tell his two little daughters that they might not be in their elementary school, that they might be living out of their van.\n",
      "I spent the next years making sure that would never happen again. Wall Street fought us every inch of the way on a consumer agency. They lost, and I won. We need a candidate with unshakable values and a candidate who can actually get something done for working people. [applause]\n",
      "JACKSON: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "WARREN: That's why I'm in this race, and that's how I'll beat Donald Trump.\n",
      "JACKSON: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: We have over . million people on Twitter, and . percent of them are decent human beings, are working people, are people who believe in justice, compassion, and love. And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.\n",
      "But let me also say what I hope my friends up here will agree with is that if you look at the wild west of the internet, talk to some of the African-American women on my campaign. Talk to Senator Nina Turner. Talk to others and find the vicious, racist, sexist attacks that are coming their way, as well.\n",
      "So I would hope that all of us understand that we should do everything we possibly can to end the viciousness and ugliness on the internet. Our campaign is about issues. It's about fighting for the working families and the middle class. It is not about vicious attacks on other people.\n",
      "JACKSON: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Senator, when you say that you disown these attacks and you didn't personally direct them, I believe you.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: But at a -- but at a certain point, you got to ask yourself, why did this pattern arise? Why is it especially the case among your supporters that this happens?\n",
      "SANDERS: I don't think it is especially the case, by the way.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: That's just not true. Look, people know the way your supporters treat them.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, Pete, if you want to talk to some of the women on my campaign, what you will see is the most ugly, sexist, racist attacks that are -- I wouldn't even describe them here, they're so disgusting.\n",
      "And let me say something else about this, not being too paranoid. All of us remember , and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up. I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me.\n",
      "I saw some of those tweets regarding the Culinary Workers Union. I have a -year  percent pro-union voting record. Do you think I would support or anybody who supports me would be attacking union leaders? It's not thinkable.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: But leadership is about what you draw out of people. It's what -- it's about how you inspire people to act. [applause]\n",
      "And right now, we're in this toxic political environment. Leadership isn't just about policy. I think at least in broad terms, we're largely pulling in the same direction on policy, but leadership is also about how you motivate people to treat other people.\n",
      "I think you have to accept some responsibility and ask yourself what it is about your campaign in particular that seems to be motivating this behavior more than others, because in order to turn the page on the Trump era, we're going to need a president, not just a candidate who can win, but a president who can move us forward.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I have an idea -- I have an idea of how we can stop sexism on the internet. We could nominate a woman for candidate for president of the United States. [applause]\n",
      "I think that might go a long way if we showed our stuff as a party.\n",
      "And the other thing I'm going to talk about is really what is at the core of this issue between Senator Sanders and the Culinary Union, and that is this. These are hard-working people, housekeepers like Elizabeth and I met with last night, who have health care plans that have been negotiated over time, sweat and blood. And that is the truth for so many Americans right now.\n",
      "JACKSON: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: There are  million Americans that would lose their current health insurance under Senator Sanders' bill. That's what it says on page .\n",
      "JACKSON: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: And I don't think we should forget that.\n",
      "JACKSON: On that note, I want to turn it over to my colleague, Chuck Todd.\n",
      "TODD: Senator Sanders, I'm going to stay on this topic, on this issue with the Culinary Union. Obviously, their leaders are warning their members about -- that your health care plan will take away their health care plan, take away private insurance completely. There are some Democrats who like you a lot but worry that this plan, Medicare for all, is going to take away private insurance and that it goes too far. Are they right?\n",
      "SANDERS: No. Let me be very clear, two points. For a hundred years, from Teddy Roosevelt to Barack Obama, this country has been talking about the need to guarantee health care for all people. And yet today, despite spending twice as much per capita, Chuck, twice as much as any other major country on Earth, we got  million who are uninsured or underinsured, we got over , people who die every year because they don't get to a doctor on time.\n",
      "We're getting ripped off outrageously by the greed and corruption of a pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us  times more for the same drugs because of their price-fixing, , people go bankrupt every year because they can't afford medical bills.\n",
      "So let me be very clear to my good friends in the Culinary Workers Union, a great union. I will never sign a bill that will reduce the health care benefits they have. We will only expand it for them, for every union in the America, and for the working class of this country. [applause]\n",
      "TODD: Senator Warren, you were all in on Medicare for all, and then you have since came up with a transition plan. Is it because of the impact on unions?\n",
      "WARREN: So I want to be clear. I've been to the Culinary Union's health care facilities. They're terrific. You don't want to shut them down. You want to expand them. You want to see them all across Nevada and all across this country.\n",
      "But we need to get everybody's health care plan out here. Mayor Buttigieg really has a slogan that was thought up by his consultants to paper over a thin version of a plan that would leave millions of people unable to afford their health care. It's not a plan. It's a PowerPoint.\n",
      "And Amy's plan is even less. It's like a Post-It note, \"Insert Plan Here.\"\n",
      "Bernie has started very much -- has a good start, but instead of expanding and bringing in more people to help, instead, his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work. And then his own advisors say, yeah, probably won't happen anyway.\n",
      "Look, health care is a crisis in this country. We need -- my approach to this is we need as much help for as many people as quickly as possible and bring in as many supporters as we can. And if we don't get it all the first time, take the win and come back into the fight to ask for more.\n",
      "TODD: Guys, I'm going to get everybody in.\n",
      "WARREN: People need our help on this.\n",
      "TODD: I got you. Mayor Buttigieg, I think she name-checked you first. I'll let you go first. [laughter]\n",

Quote, \"We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods.\" And you explained that as, quote, \"Because that's where all the crime is.\"\n",
      "You went on to say, \"And the way you should get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.\" You've apologized for that policy. But what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods?\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I'm really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with stop and frisk.\n",
      "When I got into office, there were  murders a year in New York City. And I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live. That's the basic right of everything. And we started -- we adopted a policy, which had been in place, the policy that all big police departments use, of stop and frisk.\n",
      "What happened, however, was it got out of control. And when we discovered -- I discovered that we were doing many, many, too many stop and frisks, we cut  percent of it out. And I've sat down with a bunch of African-American clergy and businesspeople to talk about this, to try to learn. I've talked to a number of kids who'd been stopped.\n",
      "And I'm trying -- was trying to understand how we change our policy so we can keep the city safe, because the crime rate did go from ,  percent down to . And we have to keep a lid on crime. But we cannot go out and stop people indiscriminately.\n",
      "HOLT: All right, Mayor...\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: And that was what was happening.\n",
      "HOLT: Let me go to Vice President Biden on this. You want to respond to that, react to it?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, let's get something straight. The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say this practice has to stop, the mayor thought it was a terrible idea we send them there, a terrible idea.\n",
      "Let's get the facts straight. Let's get the order straight. And it's not whether he apologized or not. It's the policy. The policy was abhorrent. And it was a fact of violation of every right people have. [applause]\n",
      "And we are the one, my -- our administration sent -- sent in people to moderate. And at the very time, the mayor argued against that. This idea that he figured out it was a bad idea, he figured out it was a bad idea after we sent in monitors and said it must stop. Even then, he continued the policy.\n",
      "HOLT: All right. Mayor, would you like to make a quick response to that?\n",
      "BLOOMBERG: Yes, I would. I've sat, I've apologized, I've asked for forgiveness, but the bottom line is that we stopped too many people, but the policy -- we stopped too many people. And we've got to make sure that we do something about criminal justice in this country.\n",
      "There is no great answer to a lot of these problems. And if we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel, everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there'd be nobody else up here.\n",

      "No, this isn't about how it turned out. This is about what it was designed to do to begin with. [applause]\n",
      "It targeted communities of color. It targeted black and brown men from the beginning. And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together and the willful ignorance, day by day by day, of admitting what was happening even as people protested in your own street, shutting out the sounds of people telling you how your own policy was breaking their lives.

      "KLOBUCHAR: First, I'll start with that case. It is very clear that any evidence, if there is new evidence, even old evidence, it should be reviewed by that office and by the county attorney. That must happen. I have called for that review.\n",
      "This was a case involving an -year-old African-American girl named Tyesha Edwards who was shot doing her homework at her kitchen table. Three people were convicted. One of the cases is the one that is being investigated, was investigated by a journalist. And I think it's very important that that evidence come forward.\n",
      "In terms of the police shootings that you noted, those went to a grand jury, every single one of them. And I have made very clear for months now that, like so many prosecutors, I think those cases in my time, they were all going to the grand jury. It was thought that was the best way to handle them in many, many jurisdictions.\n",
      "TODD: Do you think you should have spoke up? You didn't speak up at the time. Should you?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Did -- I actually did speak up on something very similar. And that was when our police chief in Minneapolis tried to take the investigations of police shootings into his own hands. And I strongly said I disagreed with that. Now I do believe also that a prosecutor should make those decisions herself.\n",
      "And the last thing I will say, because you asked the question about voting, I have the support of African-Americans in my community in every election. I had strong support and strong support of leadership. And that's because I earned it.\n",

      "SANDERS: Thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: And at the same time, transparency matters, especially living through the Trump era. Now, under President Obama, the standard was that the president would release full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout. I think that's the standard that we should hold ourselves to, as well.\n",

      "But I'm actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on Sanders' personal health than I am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan, since he's said that it's impossible to even know how much it's going to cost, and even after raising taxes on everybody making $,, there is still a multi-trillion-dollar hole.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, if you add up all his policies altogether, they come to $ trillion.

We cannot continue to let our public lands be used for profits by those who don't care about our environment and are not making it better.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: I have made it very clear that we have to review all of the permits that are out there right now for natural gas and then make decisions on each one of them and then not grant new ones until we make sure that it's safe. But it is a transitional fuel.\n",

And the president can do this herself without Congress, as well as the gas mileage standard.\n",

      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates, welcome. Vice President Biden, the first question is for you. In the last few days, you've been saying that Democrats will be taking too big a risk if they nominate Senator Sanders or Mayor Buttigieg, but they came out on top in Iowa. What risks did the Iowa Democrats miss?\n",
      "BIDEN: Oh, they didn't miss anything. It's a long race. I took a hit in Iowa and I'll probably take a hit here. Traditionally Bernie won by  points last time. And usually it's the neighboring senators that do well. But no matter what, I'm still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together. And so it's a simple proposition. It doesn't matter whether it's this one or the next. I've always viewed the first four encounters, two primaries, and two caucuses as the starting point. And so that's how I view it.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Why are Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg too big a risk for Democrats?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. We're going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernie's labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that's the label that the President's going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he's a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He's a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we'll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, let me give you the chance to respond first. President Trump certainly thinks this label socialism will work. At the State of the Union, he said, \"Socialism destroys nations. He's never going to let socialism destroy American healthcare.\" And before the Super Bowl, he joked was Sean Hannity about your honeymoon in Moscow. Those hits are going to keep coming if you're the nominee. Why shouldn't Democrats be worried?\n",
      "SANDERS: Because Donald Trump lies all the time. It doesn't matter what Donald Trump says, it's a sad state of affairs, it really is. He will say terrible things about Joe, he has [inaudible] ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth, about Amy, about anybody else who was up here. But I think George, that at the end of the day, the way we defeat Donald Trump and everybody up here by the way, is united. No matter who wins this damn thing, we're all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump.\n",
      "SANDERS: I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they don't believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain. And we got to bring young people into the political process. I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by , votes. What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under  by over %. If we do that nationally, we're going to defeat Donald Trump.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: But Senator, let me follow up there and then we'll move on. But back in Iowa, the turn out this year was about the same as it was in . Far below what it was in  when President Obama won.\n",
      "SANDERS: That's true. And that's the disappointment and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters. But if there is a good spot, a good aspect about that campaign, is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama's historic  campaign. And if that happens nationally, we're going to win and defeat Trump.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Before I move on to Mayor Buttigieg, let me just ask, is anyone else on the stage concerned about having a democratic socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket?\n",
      "SANDERS: I'm not.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Bernie and I work together all the time. But I think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out. And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in , I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully, Donald Trump's worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else. And I would submit that that is me.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Steyer, is socialism [inaudible]\n",
      "STEYER: I don't think there's any question, George, that after this week there's a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected. And I don't think there's any question, but that the only way that we're going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means we're going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos. If you can't do that, then we can't beat Donald Trump in November and we can't choose a candidate who can't do that. And I am doing that right now with % of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada. That's what it's going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. Someone who can pull, as Amy said, everything together in every single way we're divided.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Andrew Yang and Senator Warren then Mayor Buttigieg.\n",
      "YANG: First, let me say America, it's great to be back on the debate stage. Thank you. I'm so excited, I want to give every American $, a month. George, the entire capitalism, socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models, they did not foresee technology getting stronger, more powerful, capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye. We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs? Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides. What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family's way of life. Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness, life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, clean air, and clean water, how our kids are doing. The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our family's lives.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, you reportedly said back in , \"I'm a capitalist to my bones.\" Senator Sanders says, \"I'm not.\" Is that your biggest difference with Senator Sanders?\n",
      "WARREN: Oh, Bernie and I have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on. But there's fundamental question about how we bring our party together. We have to think about it in new ways. People across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, understand that we've got a government right now that works great for those at the top. Works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and it's not working so great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is. Corruption, and that's what we can run on. We bring our party together.\n",
      "It's an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption. We're the Democrats, we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that. They hate the corruption as well. My anti-corruption plan, good for Republicans and Democrats. That's not only how we bring our party together. That's how we're going to win in November.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg, early in the campaign you said that the word socialism has lost its power, it's mostly lost its meaning. Do you believe that or worry it could be a potent weapon in a general election?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I'm not interested in the labels. I'm not interested in what Republicans are going to say. I'm interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually, finally turn the page. In order to win, yes, but also in order to govern. This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadn't even thought of a few years or decades ago. And politically, we're facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump. So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar. Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification, when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says, if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count. A politics that says, it's my way or the highway.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you talking about Senator Sanders?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes. Because we've got to bring as many people as we can into this process. Look, all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that it's going to take in order to win. But the process of actually proving it is now underway. And now it comes to New Hampshire, a state that thinks for itself, is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging. Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on their side if we don't agree % of the time.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, your response.\n",
      "SANDERS: Needless to say, I've never said that, but let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class. The way you bring people together, Republicans, independents, Democrats, progressives, conservatives, you raise the minimum wage to  bucks an hour. The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we're not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, they're going to start paying their fair share of taxes. That's what the American people want. And I'll tell you something else, the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry they're not going to charge us  times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire. That's how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg, you just heard Senator Sanders make healthcare the center of his piece. Do you think his healthcare plan can bring people together?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I think there's a better way. It's true, the American people are ready. There's a historic majority right now, even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago. There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription. Just so long as we don't command people to accept a public plan if they don't want to. That's the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. My point is, what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants. Yes, higher wages, doubling the rate of unionization in this country, making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, delivering healthcare and college affordability. But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people. That is not only what we need in order to win, it's what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Biden, how do you unify the country?\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All. But Bernie says, and he says he wrote the damn thing, but he's unwilling to sell us with the damn thing's going to cost. The fact that we're in New Hampshire, very levelheaded group of people, look at the numbers. How much is it going to cost? Who's going to pay for it? It will cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes aren't going to go up is just crazy. When they did it in Vermont, what happened? They doubled the state income tax and then had a % tax on withholding. And they finally did away with it. So how much is it going to cost? When you ask Bernie that, and I'll ask him again tonight sometime, and if you ask Bernie that, he says, \"Go figure, I don't know, we'll find out.\"\n",
      "I think that was on CBS. He said, \" We'll find out.\" Or something to that effect. Imagine you're going to unite the country walking into the Congress, \"I got this bill. It's going to require Medicare for everybody. I can't tell you how much it's going to cost. We'll find out later and it's likely to be double whatever … everything we spent in the federal government.\" Who do you think is going to get that passed? I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed, getting every Democratic vote. I know how hard it is.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, for a start, what the studies show, if we do what Joe wants, we'll be spending some $ trillion on healthcare over the next  years. That's the status quo, Joe. That's what Health and Human Services says.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "SANDERS: And what we have got to do Joe, and what we have got to do is understand, simple question, Joe, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $ billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $ billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money. Substantial, be much less expensive than your plan. And we will expand Medicare to include dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aides and home health care as well.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Biden,  second response, then Senator Klobuchar after that.\n",
      "BIDEN:  second-\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah,  second-\n",
      "BIDEN:  second response. My proposal gives you a choice. You're going to be covered. You have Medicare if you want it, you turn [inaudible] we're going to restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare. We're going to reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, et cetera. And it cost a lot of money, it costs $ billion over  years. I tell you how I'm going to pay for it. I'm going to raise the capital gains rates, you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is. That'll pay for it, that's $ billion. But here's the deal, the fact is that it's going to cost … Bernie's plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: I keep listening to this same debate, and it is not real. It is not real, Bernie, because two thirds of the Democrats in the Senate are not on your bill and because it would kick  million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. And let me say what else, Elizabeth wants to do it in two years. And Pete, while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said, henceforth, forewith, indubitably, affirmatively, you are for Medicare for All for the ages. And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position, looking at things and sticking with them. I have long believed that the way that we expand healthcare to more people and bring down premiums is by building on the Affordable Care Act, with a nonprofit public option. That is the best way to do it.\n",
      "And practically look at this, the Affordable Care Act is now nearly  points more popular than the President of United States. So why would we talk about blowing it up? What we need to do is build on it. Mental health care, addiction, longterm care, those are the things that would make it better for everyone.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren and Mayor Buttigieg, you were both invoked. I want you each to respond and then go back to Senator Sanders.\n",
      "WARREN: So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is,  million Americans last year couldn't afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance. I want everyone in here to think about what that means. They were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor, a doctor looked at it and says that's serious enough to write a prescription. They walked out and then said, it's either that or groceries. It's that or pay them rent on time. We have got to change our healthcare system. The way [inaudible]\n",
      "WARREN: Help to the most people as quickly as we can. How about we start with what a president can do, I love saying this, all by herself. On day one, I will defend the Affordable Care Act and I will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV, AIDS, drugs and EpiPens.\n",
      "We can start making healthcare better for Americans from the beginning, but we have to agree to do that. We are the Democrats, we are on the side of expanding healthcare. When we come up against Donald Trump, the team that has been trying to take away healthcare from millions of people, what's going to matter most is we are the people on the side of those who need healthcare across this country. That's who Democrats are.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg, I want you to respond to that, but also take on the argument at the beginning from the Vice President, you don't have the right experience to be president.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Sure. Well, first of all, just to be clear, the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American. And as to experience, I just bring a different perspective. Look, I freely admit that if you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, you've got your candidate, and of course it's not me. The perspective I'm bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington, D.C. Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation. Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room. We need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past. Turn the page and bring change to Washington before it's too late.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Biden, there's his answer.\n",
      "BIDEN: The politics of the past I think were not all that bad. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $ billion Recovery Act, which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it, I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage. So I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad. What happened? What is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning.\n",
      "...Happened, what is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning. It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways, and there's ways to do that, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done, and can lead the free world at the same time.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg respond, and then Senator Sanders.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Those achievements were phenomenally important, because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment. And this moment is different. The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we're seeing coming out of China, to cybersecurity, and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago. And here at home, we're seeing things like gig work, transform what it means to be a worker in America, in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago. We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back. We have to be ready to turn the page, and change our politics before it's too late. And I'm seeing everywhere I go, not just fellow Democrats, but a striking number of independents, and, what I like to call future former Republicans ready to join in that historic American majority to turn the page.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I am listening to this about meeting the moment, and my first thought is, I'm a fresh face up here for a presidential debate, and I figure, Pete, that , my age, is the new  up here. The second thing I think about is this, and that is-\n",
      "SANDERS:  is the new .\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Okay, there you go. Meeting the moment, meeting the moment, we had a moment the last few weeks, mayor, and that moment was these impeachment hearings. And there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people. There was courage from Doug Jones, our friend of Alabama, who took that tough vote. There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took it very, very difficult vote. There was courage, as I read today, about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman being escorted out of the White House, what he did took courage. But what you said, Pete, as you were campaigning through Iowa, as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch, and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons.\n",
      "It is easy to go after Washington, because that's a popular thing to do. It is much harder, as I see Senator Shaheen in the front row, such a leader, it is much harder to lead, and much harder to take those difficult positions. Because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because it's popular to say, and makes you look like a cool newcomer. I just, I don't think that's what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.\n",
      "SANDERS: George, George, can I…\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, then Mayor Buttigieg.\n",
      "YANG: George, can I say…\n",
      "SANDERS: Look, at the end of the day, we got to ask ourselves a very simple question, whether it's healthcare in fact, or anything else. Why are we the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all people? Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Have  million people uninsured or under-insured? , die because they don't get to a doctor on time, and , people going bankrupt, for what reason? Because they have cancer or heart disease, or Alzheimer's. We got to ask that question, why is it why? Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years, and here is the answer. If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, you're going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies. You're going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, \"Sorry, we're not going to pay  times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country.\" But at the end of the day, there's no way around it. You may want to nibble around the edges, but ultimately, you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies, to tell Wall Street, to tell the insurance companies, to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us, not a handful of special interests.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg, wrap this up, and then-\n",
      "STEYER: I have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate, and they're all right, everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the Republican party, and a million times better than Donald Trump. That is not the question in front of us today. The question in front of us today is, how are we going to beat Donald Trump? You were in the Clinton campaign in , and the mantra was, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, if you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, he's saying those words, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" I trust every one of these people a million times more, but we're going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy, because if you listen to him, he's crowing about it every single day, and he's going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid. And that's the issue here. It is not about who has the best healthcare plan. All the healthcare plans are better, a million times better.\n",
      "The question is, who can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump? Who can take down Mr. Trump, because he's the real threat to the country? And let me say, you have to have experience to take him down. This is not a question of he's a nice guy who's going to listen. We need people with experience. That's why I'm worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy, and take him down on the debate stage, or we're going to lose. And that's actually the issue in front of democratic voters. I have heard this debate so many darn times, and I love all these people, and they're all right. If we win, we can get the right thing, Bernie. I am with you. If we win, we can get the right thing, Pete, and Amy, but we got to win, or we are in deep trouble, and we keep not talking about the facts.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Pete.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Here's how we're going to win. We're going to force this president to stand on that debate stage, next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood, in the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for, but turns his back on. We're going to put up somebody who's not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast, and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party. We're going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn, and remind him what serving this country is really about. If we want to beat this president, we've got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past, and unify this country around a new and better vision. That's how we're going to win. And when I talk about exhaustion, this is important, because I got to tell you, the American people, from outside of Washington, we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division, and the dysfunction there.\n",
      "And that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of Congress, and the Senate are doing. It's not. But, the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it. I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that I've spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester, and in the other states that we're in. And the important thing for the American people to remember, is this is , it's an election year. And if the Senate was the jury before, you are the jury now. The American people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president, and on the senators in the GOP who protected him.\n",
      "YANG: Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump's victory. Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems, and we're making a mistake when we act like he is.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: That's right.\n",
      "YANG: He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years, and decades. And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease. Most Americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose, I lose, you lose, I lose for years. And you know who's been losing this entire time? We have. Our communities have. Our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet. That's why Iowa, traditional swing state, went to Trump by almost  points. That's why Ohio, a traditional swing state is now so red, that I'm told we're not even going to campaign there.\n",
      "So, these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens. We've automated away four million manufacturing jobs, and counting. We're closing % of New Hampshire stores and malls, and Amazon, the force behind that, is literally paying zero in taxes. These are the changes that Americans are seeing and feeling around us every day, and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems, we will not just defeat Donald Trump in the fall, but we'll actually be able to move our communities forward.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: I know we're going to hear a lot more on this, but we're going to move on.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Thank you George. Good evening candidates. We come to you, of course, just  hours after the acquittal of President Trump. A process that has certainly crystallized the divide in our country. Senator Warren, want to start with you. You have said that on day one of your presidency, one of your first orders of business will be to order your justice department to launch new investigations into the Trump Administration. After a grueling impeachment, and what is likely to be a polarizing election, is investigating President Trump the best way to try to unify the country?\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I think no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. We watched on Wednesday as Republicans, all but one locked arms to protect him from impeachment, but we need to reestablish the rule of law in this country. I believe in an independent commission, in our justice department that investigates crimes committed by our own government. It is an important part of accountability. It is an important part for every administration, that we hold ourselves accountable to the American people. Look, people around this country are losing faith in our government. They're losing faith that government works for them. They see a government that just works great if you're rich. It works great if you're a lobbyist. It works great if you're a corporate executive, but they see themselves and their children with less and less and less, and we could do something about it.\n",
      "It's not enough simply to talk about the future. We have to be willing to stand up to those who now control our government, and make that government instead work for us. We can do child care in this country for every baby. We can invest in our public schools. We can cancel student loan debt for  million Americans, but only if we are willing to take control of our government away from the giant corporations and billionaires, return it to the people. This is about our government. This is about our democracy. This is about our future.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Mr. Yang, you said that the notion of a leader quote, throwing the president before them in jail is not the way things are done here in the United States. It would make it quote, very hard for any party to govern sustainably moving forward. Does that mean that any alleged misconduct by the president or his administration should not be investigated?\n",
      "YANG: There are of course limits, and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office, but the fact is, if you look around the world, the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail, have generally been developing countries, and unfortunately that's a pattern that once you establish, is very, very hard to break. What's a more American tradition? We move the country forward. We don't focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office. Most Americans do not care about what a particular individual did, so much as they care about their family's wellbeing, their community, their town. That's where Americans focus wants. They want the American president. They want the present. Of course, the American president, sorry about that. They want the president to be focused on that, and that's where our attention should be. We should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Senator Sanders.\n",
      "SANDERS: Along with Elizabeth and Amy, we sat for two weeks listening to the impeachment process, and here's what I think the horror and the danger of what happened was not only the acquittal of Trump, who in fact committed impeachable offenses, and obstructed Congress. It is the precedent that it set. The precedent that it set. And what that precedent is about now is in the future, you're going to have presidents who say, \"Hey, governor, you want highway money? You better support me, or you're not going to get it.\" Because I am the president, I can do anything I want.\n",
      "Hey, Congress, you want to investigate me? Don't be ridiculous. Who cares about the Congress? Who cares about the separation of powers? Who cares about the constitution of the president? I'm the President of the United States. I have all of the power, and I'm able to intimidate members of my own party. The saddest aspect of this whole thing, is you have Republicans in the Senate who knew better. They knew that Donald Trump is a crook. They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat, but they didn't have the guts, with the exception of Romney to vote against him. That is a sad day.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: So, I did start the Need to Impeach movement in October of . And my father was one of the people who prosecuted the Nazi war criminals after World War II. And that's part of the reason I started it. Because when you see something really wrong in the United States, you're supposed to stand up against it, and fight against it. And that's what I was doing. But he's been, the Republicans have rolled over, they've had a sham trial, they've refused to have witnesses. They've covered up the truth for the American people. And it doesn't matter anymore that he's a crook, and he's always been a crook, and he always will be a crook. Right now, what we have to do is we have to beat him in November, and we have to beat him because he's incompetent, and bad for the American people. And that's the case we have to make now.\n",
      "Is he a crook? I knew that two years ago. Is he going to be more of a crook, now that he believes he can get away with anything? Of course he is. But the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in November, and that's going to be based on what we can deliver for the American people. The fact that he's incompetent as a president, his economy isn't delivering for working people. The jobs don't pay enough for people to live on. We've got to take him down on the economy, and get them out of the White House as soon as possible.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Thank you Mr. Steyer. Impeachment is of course over. But Republicans in Congress have already started investigating vice president Biden's son, Hunter. Mayor Buttigieg, do you think that there's a danger for the democratic party to nominate a candidate who is still under the threat of investigation?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: No, and we're not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden, or vice president Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president. The vice president and I and all of us are competing. But we've got to draw a line here. And to be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing, that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Vice president Biden.\n",
      "BIDEN: I thank my colleague for saying that. It is a diversion, but here's the deal. Whomever the nominee is, the president's going to make up lies about. He thinks he has free reign right now. One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what we're going to do and how we're going to do it. And by the way, Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House, walked out. I think at the same time, he should have been pinning a medal on Vindman, and not on rush Limbaugh. And I think we should all stand and give Colonel Vindman a show of how much we supported him. Stand up and clap for Vindman. Get up there. Who we are. That's who we are. We are not what Trump is.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Thank you Vice President Biden. The Democratic party's last presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders track record in the senate.\n",
      "SANDERS: I wasn't able to hear that question.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Okay sure. The democratic party's last presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has criticized Senator Bernie Sanders record in the senate, saying, \"Nobody likes him. Nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done.\" Senator Klobuchar, you served with Senator Sanders in the Senate. Is he going to be able to get the support? Not if you like him, but is he going to be able to get the support that he needs from Republicans?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I like Bernie just fine. We actually have worked together on a number of things, including pharmaceuticals. We actually had a vote late at night one time, Klobuchar/ Sanders amendment to bring in less-\n",
      "SANDERS: I thought it was Sanders/Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Nope, nope, nope, it was not, it was not. To bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, since in this great state of New Hampshire, like in Minnesota and Vermont, we can see Canada from our porch. And we ended up getting I think  Republican votes. And they might not have noticed what was happening late at night, but we got those. And I think that it is just an example of what we need to do here, because I've been listening to this discussion. I agree with my colleagues, we must unite, but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for America. That is what we must do, and that means taking on a president, if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on.\n",
      "Taking on a president that literally went down to Mar-a-Lago after he signed that Republican tax bill, and looked at all his friends and said, \"You just got a lot richer.\" That is exhibit A for those carpenters in Pennsylvania, and those dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and those dock workers that I met with in Michigan. That is an exhibit A, and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country, some of whom voted for Donald Trump, that we have something better to offer. That we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill, and put that money into their childcare, into their healththere.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Senator, just a quick yes or no. Do you think that Senator Sanders will be able to get Republican support in order to pass his bills?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: That, I don't know. I know we did on that bill, but the point is, I think we're better off with someone that has the receipts. Someone that has actually won big time with Republicans and independents, and I'm the only one up on this stage, you can check it out, that has consistently won in red congressional districts. Not once, not twice, but three times. And when I did this, I didn't just do it for me. I led a ticket. I've flipped the state house every single time, because I have a way of working with people, that I think should be valued here as we look at these candidates, and it's one of the reasons that I got the New York Times endorsement, along with Elizabeth, and that I got the endorsements of the three major papers here in New Hampshire, which is the Union Leader, the Seacoast papers, and the Keene Sentinel. I think that matters. Read those editorials, and you will get a sense of what I'm about.\n",
      "SPEAKER #: Thank you Senator. Senator Sanders.\n",
      "SANDERS: I must confess, I don't get too many newspaper editorial support. Must confess that.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, you the Conway endorsement.\n",
      "SANDERS: I did. We're very proud of that.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: There we go.\n",
      "SANDERS: But, let me just say this. I think the question started off with Secretary Clinton's critique. I think, quite honestly, as we face one of the great political crises facing America, our job is to look forward and not back to . And I hope that Secretary Clinton and all of us can come together, and move in that direction. Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say...in that direction. Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say that in my own great state of Vermont, if my memory is correct, Amy, I got % of the Republican vote. And in fact, there were periods when I was in the House of Representatives, a number of years where I passed more amendments on the floor of the House in a bipartisan way than any other member of the House and that is when you bring people together on an issue. There are many conservative Republicans, for example, who are concerned about civil liberties, at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties. There are Republicans, as you know, who are concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs. There are ways that we can work with Republicans on issues where we have a common basis.\n",
      "LINDSEY: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let's do that.\n",
      "LINDSEY: David.\n",
      "MUIR: Lindsey, thank you. Good evening, all. I want to turn to America's role in the world and readiness to be commander-in-chief on day one. Just this week, you saw it, during the State of the Union, President Trump offered an indication of what he'll tout on the campaign trail. He celebrated the US air strike that killed top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani saying, \"Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq.\"\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, you're the only veteran standing on this stage and while there is still debate about whether or not there was an imminent threat, there is no debate about whether or not Soleimani was a bad actor who was responsible for the deaths of many Americans. Given what you know about Soleimani, if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike, would Soleimani have been dead or would he still be alive under your presidency?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: In the situation that we saw with President Trump's decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer. Look, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated. It's also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing. This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war, but it didn't start with the Soleimani strike. It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working. And it's time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war, that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve.\n",
      "By chance, just because I was traveling for the campaign, not long ago, I ran into somebody that I hadn't seen since we were both serving, hadn't seen since she was injured in an insider attack. And I saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a Wounded Warrior Project tee shirt that said, \"Some assembly required.\" And when I asked her how she was doing, she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldn't save, tapped on the prosthetic and said the Navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment.\n",
      "The people in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them. What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence, pay attention to the international security situation, consult with our allies, keep US politics out of it, and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harm's way if there is an alternative.\n",
      "MUIR: Mayor Buttigieg, let me just press further on this though, because president Trump has signal in a general election campaign, he will celebrate his willingness to order that strike. I'm asking if your national security team came to you and presented you with the opportunity, would you take the strike?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: It depends on the circumstances. It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be. That's my point. This is not an episode of . This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture. This president has insulted the intelligence community, but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified. And I don't think he even reads it.\n",
      "And here we have a situation where the world, that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military, not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to Colonel Vindman, but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor. We deserve a better commander-in-chief.\n",
      "MUIR: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. I do want to take this to Vice President Biden next because we know that the Obama Administration was aware of the threat that Soleimani posed, so was the Bush Administration before it. I'm asking tonight as commander-in-chief though, would you have ordered the strike?\n",
      "BIDEN: No. And the reason I wouldn't have ordered the strike, there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him. Look what happened, his America First policies made America alone. You cannot think of a time, David, and as long as you've been alive when NATO has said to the United States of America and to Iran, made a moral equivalence and said, both of you stand down. We are alone now, alone in that region of the world, without friends, without support, without allies.\n",
      "And secondly, you saw what happened when that air raid, when those missiles were fired from Iran into Iraq at Al-Assad Airbase,  of our heroes were wounded. I don't know what I would've done if my son were still there. I would have been so damn angry. I don't know what I would've done. But here's what happened, they had received traumatic brain injury. What did the president say? He said, \"headaches,\" \"not bad,\" \"Headaches, that's all they are.\" This guy doesn't deserve to be commander- in-chief for one more day.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice President, thank you, Senator Sanders, you have called this, \"assassinating a government official.\" You would not have ordered the strike.\n",
      "SANDERS: Right. Look, here is the danger, David, there are very bad leaders all over the world. Kim Jong-un in North Korea is probably responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of his people threatening all of Asia with nuclear weapons. You got Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia who is a terrible murderer, who murdered Khashoggi in cold blood and dismembered his body. You have Putin in Russia who has been involved in political assassinations of his enemies. You got Xi in China who has put a million Muslims into concentration camps.\n",
      "You cannot go around saying you're a bad guy, we're going to assassinate you, and then you're going to have, if that happens, you're opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination. What we have got to do, which Trump does not understand, is strengthen the State Department and our diplomatic capabilities, not just the military. What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say, you know what, let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN, not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Sanders, thank you. This does take me to Afghanistan and to America's longest war. Senator Warren, you recently said quote, \"We have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, 'We've just turned the corner,' and then what happens? It's all the same. Someone new comes in and says, 'We've just turned the corner.' You said, \"So many say it. We're going in circles.\"\n",
      "We were on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq in recent months and the generals told us that the US needs some US presence on the ground, US special forces some presence to go after ISIS and the terrorists. If your commander-in-chief, would you listen to the generals or do they fall into the category of the generals you've mentioned before?\n",
      "WARREN: No. Look, I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so I get the briefings from the generals on a regular basis. I've been to Afghanistan, to Iraq. I've been to Jordan. I've been throughout the region. I've been there with John McCain. I've been there with Lindsey Graham to ask the hard questions about what's happening, to ask our generals, to ask their generals to ask people who are on the ground. And the bottom line is, nobody sees a solution to this war. Nobody can describe what winning looks like. All they can describe is endless war.\n",
      "And I realized there are people on this debate stage who are willing to say, yeah, we'll leave our troops there for five more years, for  more years. Lindsey Graham has said he's willing to leave troops for  more years. And yet, what has all these years of war brought us? Right now, the Afghan Government controls less than % of the land. People don't have faith in it. It's a corrupt government. The opium trade is higher than ever.\n",
      "Look, we sent our troops in and they did their best. They were there for us, but we need to be there for them. And that means, not send our troops to do work that cannot be solved militarily. It is time to bring our combat troops home. It is time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Warren, I want to press you on this. You just said, \"combat troops.\"\n",
      "WARREN: Yes.\n",
      "MUIR: So if the generals came to you and said, we need US Special Forces, some footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan, would you listen? Would you leave them?\n",
      "WARREN: So I want to hear the plan, not just a, we need it now, we need it for the next day, we need it for the six months. And I want to know where our allies are. We all have an interest in dealing with terrorism and controlling terrorism, but that means it can't just be the United States waging endless war. That does not make us safer. It does not make the region safer. It does not make the world safer. We should work with our allies in managing terrorism, but we need to end this war in Afghanistan. We cannot wait five more years, or  more years, or until we turn the corner  more times. We need to bring our combat troops home.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Warren, thank you. I want to take this to the Vice President because you have said of Senator Warren's comments before that the United States should get out of the Middle East. You have said, \"I quite frankly was surprised that I have never heard anyone say with any serious background in foreign policy that we should pull all troops out of the Middle East.\" Is Senator Warren wrong on this?\n",
      "BIDEN: I'm not sure what she, if she wants to pull all troops out of the Middle East, but if she does want to put all troops out of the Middle East, we saw what happens when that happened.\n",
      "I helped put together a  nation group to take out ISIS by putting fewer than , forces along the Turkish border to see to it that they, and they lost ,, the Kurds, lost , lives. They defeated ISIS. They ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man I know very well, they've now, the guy running Turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a Democrat, and what happened? We pulled out and you saw what happened. You saw the end of the effort to be able to continue to contain, contain ISIS, number one.\n",
      "Number two, close your eye, everybody. Remember what you saw on television. You saw a woman standing up there holding up her baby, Kurd, saying, \"Please don't leave us.\" And our military women and men standing at, going out in their...[inaudible]...Humvees with their heads down ashamed of what they did. It didn't take a lot of men or men and women to do what needed to be done.\n",
      "And with regard Afghanistan, now I can say it because it was made public, I was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in Afghanistan. The only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region. I've been in every part of Afghanistan, not in combat like my friend has, but in helicopter and/or on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president. Here's what I saw, there is no possibility of uniting that country, no possibility at all of making it a whole country. But it is possible to see to it that they're not able to launch more attacks from the region on the United States of America. That's a small footprint that we needed and I argued for that in the beginning.\n",
      "MUIR: You mentioned Mayor Buttigieg. And I do want to take this to you next, mayor. Given your finish in Iowa, you've come under increasing scrutiny, attacks from opponents on experience. We've heard that theme even right here tonight. You have said on the Iraq War, for example. \"I just don't believe there is any justification for that vote.\" You said, \"It's the difference between tenure and judgment.\" That it's the judgment that matters, not the time in Washington. Vice President Biden, as you know, voted yes. As commander-in-chief, do you believe your judgment would be better than the vice president's?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy. And looking forward, we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before. It's not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq, it's about preventing a war with Iran. And not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that we've been doing throughout, the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community.\n",
      "At a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats, in President Trump's imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators. It's a th century approach to keeping a place safe. What we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships, but defining a strategy to keep the American people safe from fundamentally new challenges.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice President, I'll let you respond to his argument on judgment.\n",
      "BIDEN: I made a mistake and I said it  years ago. I trusted George Bush to keep his word. He said he was not going to go into Iraq. He said he was only using this to unite the United Nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what Saddam was doing. When we got elected, the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said, \"Joe, I want you to organize getting , troops out of Iraq.\" I did that. I did that.\n",
      "The other thing I want to point out too is that NATO is in fact going to crumble if we don't beat Trump. NATO is in real trouble. We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security. We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before. It wasn't just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States, coming into Europe. It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf. I know how to deal with them. I know every one of these world leaders by their first names. They call me. I talked to them and I believe I can get it done.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice President, thank you. Mr. Steyer, I do want to bring you in on this because I noticed in the last  hours you have an attack ad running here in New Hampshire with images of Mayor Buttigieg and you say over those images \"an untested newcomer.\" But I wanted to ask you tonight on this readiness to be commander-in-chief, you share the stage with a veteran from Afghanistan, a vice president who was in the Situation Room. What makes you most qualified of all candidates on this stage to be commander-in-chief?\n",
      "STEYER: Well, let me say this, I agree with Pete Buttigieg that it's about judgment not tenure. What we're hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how America should be the world's policemen. And what we've actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world. So when we're talking about our role in the world and commander-in-chief, we have abandoned a diplomacy. We don't have a strategy and we don't have allies.\n",
      "And actually this view of the world, that our response should be military is driven by our gigantic military complex and ignores the biggest problem that we face internationally in the world, which is climate change. And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes. It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries. So in fact, what we are listening to right here is a discussion of  years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending $ billion dollars a year on defense when we spend $ billion dollars a year at the federal level on education.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Steyer [crosstalk]\n",
      "STEYER: Let's talk about judgment here. [crosstalk]\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice President, I'll give you  seconds to respond.\n",
      "BIDEN: That's not what I said, I was part of the reason putting that deal together with Iran. I was there. I was involved in that. I was also part of the deal putting together the Paris Climate Accord. I brought in the Chinese. I was part of that. I've been part of every major initiative we've had relative to diplomacy. I have not argued for the placement of major numbers of US combat troops. I have said, along with the President of the United States, Barack Obama as his partner, I have said, we have to strengthen NATO to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them. Like we don't keep our commitments to the Kurds. We must keep our commitments when we make them. Otherwise, we have no power whatsoever.\n",
      "And it's not about making sure we're policeman of the world. The only way not to become the policeman of the world is to have allies who will join us in dealing with failed States and terrorism. And it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesn't require large number of US troops, and I've never said that.\n",
      "STEYER: Okay, can I respond to that, David?\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, please.\n",
      "STEYER: Can I respond to...\n",
      "[crosstalk].\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me say this if I might, like Joe and others, I also heard the arguments in terms of the war in Iraq from Bush, from Cheney, from John Bolton, from the whole administration. I listened very carefully and I concluded that they were lying through their teeth. And I not only voted against that war, but I help lead the opposition. And it saddens me so much. If you hear what I said, it's on YouTube, my fears about all the destabilization that would take place by the US invading Iraq. It's sad to me that, that is what happened.\n",
      "But let me just pick up on a point that Tom made, which is absolutely right. Trump wants to build a wall around America. The problem is if we are going to deal with issues like climate change, not only do we in America have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, we have to lead the entire world. This is not an American issue. It's a global issue. We got to bring China and Russia and Brazil and Pakistan and India and every major country on earth into the fight against climate change.\n",
      "And here is my dream, maybe it's a radical dream, but maybe just may be given the crisis of climate change, the world can understand that instead of spending $. trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.\n",
      "MUIR: [crosstalk] Senator Sanders, thank you. George, back to you.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: We have much more today coming up, but we have got to take a break. We'll be right back.\n",
      "[commercial break]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Welcome back of Saint Anselm College here in New Hampshire and we are here every four years, thanks to our amazing Manchester partner WMUR. And now anchor Monica Hernandez and political director Adam Section are joining us with questions on the minds of New Hampshire voters.\n",
      "HERNANDEZ: Thank you George. It's an honor to be here in our community. We know Granite Staters are engaged and we know there are issues that strike especially close to home here. New Hampshire has one of the highest rates of deadly overdoses in the country. In some cases, police and paramedics tell us that they are saving the same lives again and again, sometimes more than once in a single day. It's a healthcare issue, but it's also so much more. Mayor Buttigieg, you have described yourself as a moderate, but one of your policies at least goes further than some on the stage with you are willing to go. You have called for the decriminalization of all drugs. Does that include heroin, meth, and cocaine, some of the drugs that have contributed to this crisis?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: No. What I've called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession.\n",
      "HERNANDEZ: With all due respect Mayor Buttigieg, on your website it says that you called for decriminalization of all drugs.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Again, what I'm calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response. This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs, but also as we know from the opioid crisis, some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful. It's why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable. We've got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances. Even while we're also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue, not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction.\n",
      "That's why medication assisted treatment is so important. And those people who are being revived, and our own EMTs in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody, but then they have nowhere to go. Sometimes you get brought back with a dose of Narcan, but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you, because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country. We must act to change that and save lives when we do.\n",
      "HERNANDEZ: I want to bring this question now to Mr. Yang. You've said you would decriminalize opioids, but you've also said that you would require all overdose patients to go to mandatory treatment centers for three days. Right now in New Hampshire there aren't enough beds in treatment centers and across the country. How would you make sure treatment is available for all overdose patients and what would you do to fill the gap in the meantime?\n",
      "YANG: That's what we have to change, Monica. I've heard heartbreaking stories from families here in New Hampshire that have been destroyed, torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money. As President, we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in New Hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment, you have resources to be able to pursue it.\n",
      "This is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem, but money cannot be the obstacle. This is something that happened on the government's watch. The government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment, you know you're not going to be sent to jail. We have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you.\n",
      "If you have a family member who's struggling, you can refer them and know that they're not going to have criminal penalties as a result. There are so much about this that's endemic to what's happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok, this hyper corporate capitalism where if money's on one side in this country and people are on the other side, the money is winning. You can see it with the opiate epidemic. You can see it with the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel companies. This is what must change and that's where I'll lead as president.\n",
      "HERNANDEZ: Senator Klobuchar, I want to take the question to you now. As a prosecutor, you embrace tough on crime policies, even with drug offenders. You've also spoken many times about your father's own addiction issues, his own alcoholism and his DUI arrests. If addiction is a disease, should people be arrested for it and as a prosecutor, do you regret sending people with substance abuse issues to jail?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I led one of the most successful drug courts in the country in Hennepin County, and I always would say and believed, and I think my record shows this, that we weren't a business. We didn't want to see repeat customers. And if you don't want to see repeat customers, the only answer is treatment. And maybe you're referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs. Yes, I felt that we should prosecute those people, but when it comes to, when you asked Mr. Yang a question, and I think it, we owe it to the people of New Hampshire, had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids, to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed. I've been very clear about this.\n",
      "There's going to be a major settlement coming through, a federal settlement against all these opioid manufacturers. The evidence is overwhelming, including an email where one guy, a business guy, says to the other, \"They're eating them like Doritos. Just keep pumping them out.\" We will get a conservative estimate, $ billion in from that settlement, we can put a  cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another  billion. Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $ billion. And just like every other policy I've proposed, and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this, I have showed how I'm going to pay for it. Because I think we have someone in the White House that has told over , lies. He makes all kinds of promises. The people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better. I will get this done and it is personal for me.\n",
      "SEXTON: Good evening candidates. New Hampshire is a battleground, not just for presidential contenders but also for top issues and that includes gun policy. Senator Sanders, for many voters in this Democratic primary, your allure is about consistency when it comes to progressive issues you've been on the right side of them for a long time. One exception is gun rights. In the 's when you were in Congress, you voted against background checks. You also voted against a waiting period for purchase of a firearm. Can you explain why you opposed these things that you now support?\n",
      "SANDERS: I can Adam, and let me also say that in  I probably lost a race for Congress, and we only have one Congress person in the whole state, because in  I said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country. That was  years ago. Furthermore, I am very proud that today I have a D- voting record from the NRA. And under my administration it will be the American people doing gun policy, not dictated by the NRA.\n",
      "But to answer your question, I come, like New Hampshire, from a very, very rural state. In Vermont until the last two years ago, we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and I represented that perspective. The world has changed. In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country, people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen. The world has changed and my views have changed, and my view is right now we need universal background checks, we end the gun show loophole, we end the so called straw man provision. We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country, and we go further. We go further, but at the bottom line is I will not be intimidated by the NRA. We're going to run the gun policy that the American people want.\n",
      "SEXTON: Vice President Biden, you've taken a lot of heat in this primary, on these debate stages and from voters here in New Hampshire for your past positions. You've essentially asked them to look at the totality of your record and give you the benefit of the doubt. Does Senator Sanders deserve that same benefit of the doubt on guns?\n",
      "BIDEN: Here's the deal. The biggest mistake that Bernie made, that Senator Sanders made, he voted to give the gun manufacturers, the only major industry in America, a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating. First thing I'll do as President is work to get rid of that. It's going to be hard. Think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died. And I might add Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people [inaudible] your gun state and they've come around. In fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands during the same period.\n",
      "I come from a state that's a major gun owning stare. I introduced the first assault weapons ban. I in fact got it passed. I'm the only guy that beat the NRA twice. While I was pushing the Brady Background Bill to check background checks, Bernie voted five times against that when he was in the House. So look, the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did, I'm the guy that set up drug courts. I set them up. I wrote it into law and it never got funded. And also on opioids, I'm the guy who's already begun to make a down payment. In the Cures Act I put in $ billion to fight opioid addiction. And lastly, my time is going to be up, surely. Here's the deal. Those Chief Executive Officer of drug companies, they should not only be fined, they should go to jail.\n",
      "SEXTON: Senator Warren, we'd like to go over to you now. [inaudible] I want to ask you this question here though. Laws can do so much, if you could change one thing about America's gun culture, what would it be?\n",
      "WARREN: Look, we have a gun violence problem in America. It is about the mass shootings that we hear about in our schools and that frighten us, about it in theaters and in churches. It's also though about shootings that occur on sidewalks and in playgrounds, often in communities of color that are hit hardest, but there are no headlines over those. It's also about suicide and the increasing lethality of suicide because of the availability of guns. It is also about the increased chances that it's usually a woman will die of domestic violence if she is with a violent man and a gun is in the home.\n",
      "We need to think of this problem not as one and done or three things and done. We need to think of it just like we did on auto safety. We just keep coming back. We treat it like the public health emergency that it is. But the question we should be asking ourselves is when America, across this country, including gun owners, agree in certain basic things, universal background checks, get assault weapons off the streets. Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate?\n",
      "And the answer is %, think about this, more than % of Americans agree on this. We can't get a vote in the United States Senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots. Until we attack the corruption in Washington, the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying, we're not going to be able to meet our promises. And one more, until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster, the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make. We have to be willing to build a future that works, not for a gun industry, but that works for the rest of America and protects our children.\n",
      "BIDEN: We ought to be able to sue the gun industry.\n",
      "MUIR: Thank you, candidates. We're going to go back to David up there [inaudible]. Adam and Monica, thank you and thanks to WMUR tonight. I want to turn to the Supreme Court, the balance on the court and the issues before the court right now. President Trump in just the last  hours saying we've appointed  federal judges, two Supreme Court Justices, keeping his campaign promise to shift the Court to the right with Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n",
      "The Affordable Care Act is at the court. Climate change is working its way to the court, and a major abortion case is on the docket this year. Vice President Biden, on the issue of abortion, in  you said, \"President Obama's two Supreme Court picks of them, there was no litmus test. We picked people who had an open mind, did not come with an agenda.\" And you've said before, \"We both believed that we should not apply narrow litmus tests to appointees to the Supreme Court.\" Let me just ask, would you do it differently as President, Mr. Vice President? Would there be a litmus test on abortion?\n",
      "BIDEN: If you say the rest of what I said. I said that we're going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution. That's not a specific test. It's a generic test. And only way, the only reason women have the right to choose is because it's determined that there's unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution. That's what I said. And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan, who worked for me, we got onto the Supreme Court. I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court. I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in. I presided, and I'm the reason why this right wasn't taken away a long time ago because I almost single handedly made sure that Robert Bork did not get on the Court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights [inaudible].\n",
      "MUIR: So let me just-\n",
      "BIDEN: Let's get that straight.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice President, I am aware of what you said, which is why I'm asking would you do it differently now? Would there be a litmus test on abortion?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes. Look, here's the deal. Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution. A woman does have a right to choose. I would in fact, if they rule it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass, I believe, a bill that… Excuse me, legislates Roe V. Wade adjusted by Casey. It's a woman's right to do that. Period. And if you call that a litmus test it's a litmus test, but what I was talking about in the past, so no one gets confused here, is if there is no… If you read the Constitution very, very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights. If the doesn't say it in the Constitution that doesn't exist, you cannot have any of the things I care about, any of the things I care about as a progressive member of the United States Congress at the time, and as Vice President and as a member of society.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice president, thank you. Senator Warren.\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I've lived in an America in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and that's what we have to remember about this. States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies, then it's going to mean we can't simply rely on the courts. Three out of every four people in America believe right now that the rule of Roe versus Wade should be the law. That means we should be pushing for a Congressional solution as well. It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a woman's choice.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Warren, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, I do want to come to you. Should there be a litmus test? It's an active hall here tonight. I did want to come to you on this question.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\n",
      "MUIR: Should there be a litmus test on abortion?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I would only appoint judges that would respect precedent and one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade. In addition, you have got to put it into law. Donald Trump, and I think it's really important to take it to him here, when he was running for election, and this is a case I will make on the debate stage against him, he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail. He then dialed it back and said, \"No, I want to put doctors in jail.\" Is it a big surprise then we're seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions. It's not. And that is why it's going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding Planned Parenthood, for making sure women have access to contraception, to making sure that they have a right to choose, that we make this case strongly and loudly.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Klobuchar, thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, you have signaled that you'd be open to the idea of expanding the Court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested leaving the Court as it is, saying quote, \"Nine seems to be a good number.\" And in fact she said if the number of justices is increased quote, \"It would make the Court appear partisan. It would be one side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges to have more people who will vote the way we want them to.'\" Is Justice Ginsburg wrong?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence. What I've called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench, but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today. And the time has come for us to think bigger, not just reforming the makeup of the court as America, by the way, has done several times in our history. But also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the Constitution for a reason and we shouldn't be afraid to use it.\n",
      "It's not something you do lightly or quickly, but when it comes to something like Citizens United, which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an op-ed to your local paper, we need a Constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy.\n",
      "MUIR: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. Vice President Biden, I do want to come to you on this. President Trump has said that the only reason Democrats want to expand the Court is they want to try and catch up. You have called any expansion of the court a bad idea, adding, \"We will live to rue that day.\" Do you agree with President Trump on-\n",
      "BIDEN: I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That's who I agree with. And I agree the way you deal with Citizens United is pass a constitutional amendment I introduced  years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections. Period. Not private money, not billionaires, not money from special interests. Period. That's the way to amend the Constitution to deal with that. In addition to that, if in fact… Look, the Democrats stood up against the man I've revered, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he wanted to expand the Court. But they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government. It says the President shell nominate, the Senate shall dispose, the Senate shall make that decision, not the president. He can nominate.\n",
      "That's why it's so important we must win back the United States Senate this time out. And that's why as you all look at it up here in New Hampshire and around the world, excuse me, around the country, you have to ask yourself, who is most likely to help get a Senator elected in North Carolina, Georgia? Who can win Florida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota? Who can do that? Because you got to be able to win those… Well, you can. I agree. But here's the point. You've got to be able to, you've got to be able to not just win, you've got to bring along a United States Senate or this becomes moot.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Sanders\n",
      "[crosstalk].\n",
      "SANDERS: Look, you asked the simple question, is there a litmus test for those of us up here? For me there is. I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who was not % pro Roe v. Wade. Number two, we have got a codify Roe v. Wade into legislation. Number three, we have to significantly expand funding for Planned Parenthood.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Steyer, I want to bring you in on this because you have claimed that when it comes to the Supreme Court, you have said Republicans have been cheating.\n",
      "STEYER: Sure they've been cheating. Look, what we saw Mitch McConnell do, not just in the Supreme Court with Merrick Garland, but across the board with federal judges, was refuse to allow President Obama's picks to be considered. That's why Mr. Trump has appointed so many federal judges, because in fact the Republicans refused to allow President Obama to get his due, and honestly, we're sitting here talking about do you have a litmus test? We all have the litmus test. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a woman's right to choose. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way on gun control. Every single one in this row feels the same way.\n",
      "There's something else going on. These Republicans are in control. They're stacking the Court for a generation with young right-wing radicals, and we've watched it happen and the question is what are we going to do about it? That's where we are in the United States, and the question is… Actually Joe Biden's right. We have to go win a huge victory this year, and we're in trouble. And so the question is going to be, look at these people, who can pull together the Democratic Party?\n",
      "And let me say this, we have not said one word tonight about race. Not one word. Are you kidding me? We have the most diverse party. We have a very diverse country. We have a very diverse party. The heart and soul of this party is diversity, black people, Latinos, AAPI people, Native Americans and white people. But for goodness sakes, pull it together. We're talking about something different. The question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls? What are we saying? Everybody on this stage feels the same way about a woman's right to choose and economic justice. The question is how do we beat Trump? How do we take down these Republicans? And the answer is we've got to show we can take them down on growth, job creation, the economy. We send them packing and then we get all of this including beating the corporations.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr Steyer, thank you. The night is still young. Many questions to come, and Linsey Davis is next.\n",
      "DAVIS: I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mayor Buttigieg…\n",
      "MUIR: Linsey Davis is next.\n",
      "DAVIS: I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mayor Buttigieg, under your leadership as mayor, a black resident in South Bend, Indiana was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident. Now, that racial disparity is higher than the rest of the state, in fact, it's higher than the rest of the nation, and that disparity increased in South Bend after you took office.\n",
      "When talking about the problem on national terms, you've called it \"evidence of systemic racism.\" You were mayor for eight years, so weren't you, in effect, the head of the system, and how do explain that increase in black arrests under your leadership?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune. I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department, but we've got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies.\n",
      "Earlier, we were talking about opioids, and thankfully, America has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem. But there were a lot of people, including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point, it's great that everybody's so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the s? That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it, do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration, disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with.\n",
      "DAVIS: Right, let me go back to the original question though. How do you explain the increase in black arrests in South Bend under your leadership for marijuana possession?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: And again, the overall rate was lower than the national rate.\n",
      "DAVIS: No, there was an increase. The year before you were in office, it was lower. Once you became in office in , that number went up. In , the last number year that we have record for, that number was still up.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target, when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence, which was slaughtering so many in our community, burying teenagers, disproportionately black teenagers, we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.\n",
      "These things are all connected, but that's the point. So are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism, not just from criminal justice, but from our economy, from health, from housing, and from our democracy itself.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Warren, is that a substantial answer from Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "WARREN: No. You have to own up to the fact, and it's important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system. For the exact same crimes, study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained, to be arrested, to be taken to trial, to be wrongfully convicted, and receive harsher sentences. We need to rework our criminal justice system, from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system, and how we help people come back into the community.\n",
      "But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically. We need to start having race-conscious laws. Housing, for example, I have a great housing plan to build more housing in America, but understand it was the policy of the United States of America to discriminate against African Americans and any other people of color for buying homes until . You can't just repeal that and say \"Okay, now everything is even.\" It's not. We need race-conscious laws in education and employment, in entrepreneurship, to make this country a country of opportunity for everyone, no matter the color of their skin.\n",
      "YANG: Elizabeth, with respect, you can't regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific. What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $ a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net work is not % of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all. We can't regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities. The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Sanders, then Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: Let me say this, I disagree. Andrew, no, let me say this. I disagree with you Andrew. I am the person on this stage who will say openly, I'm for reparations. Something wrong happened. I am for reparations to African Americans in this country, and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality. In fact, three days ago, one of the leaders of Joe Biden's South Carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign, and the Legislative Black Caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign. Joe, I'm asking you to come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say. It was wrong, and I'm asking you to join us. Be on the right side.\n",
      "BIDEN: I'm asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of that Black Caucus. I have more support in South Carolina in the Black Caucus and the black community than anybody else. Double what you have, or anybody else here.\n",
      "SANDERS: I don't think that's quite right.\n",
      "STEYER: But wait a second, wait a second. Bernie.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, that is quite right.\n",
      "STEYER: Let's not argue about polls. Bernie, this isn't about polls.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Sanders …\n",
      "BIDEN: This is not about polls. I'm not talking about polls.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me just say, first of all, we have nine members of the Black Caucus in South Carolina supporting us, but more importantly, much of what Elizabeth said is absolutely correct. We have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare, housing, criminal justice, education, you name it. And clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with. But in terms of criminal justice, what we have got to do is understand the system is broken, is racist. We invested our young people in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. We end private prisons and detention centers in America.\n",
      "STEYER: Bernie, I appreciate what you're saying.\n",
      "SANDERS: And, excuse me, we also, most people don't know this. Tonight in America, , people are in jail without having been convicted of anything.\n",
      "STEYER: That's right.\n",
      "SANDERS: , people, because they can't afford the $ for bail they need to get out of jail. That is outrageous, we're going to end cash bail in America.\n",
      "STEYER: Okay, let me say this. I've worked, Bernie, I've worked to end cash bail in California and it's gone. I've worked to end private prisons in California and they're gone. I'm somebody who's, our family, my wife and I started a bank specifically to support businesses owned by women, black people, and Latinos, because they couldn't get financing anywhere else. But I, Joe, I want a answer. Really. I think you should come over and disavow the statements that this man made that were openly racist, that were wrong, and the Legislative Black Caucus is against. I'm asking you to join us and do the right thing.\n",
      "BIDEN: I've already spoken to Dick Harpootlian and he in fact is, I believe, sorry for what he said. But here's the deal, folks. We've got to stop taking the black community for granted. That's the starting place. Every one of the things we talked about here, for example, in South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, he has a program, --. We should be investing our money in those communities that haven't gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities. Make it a priority. We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense, they go directly, mandatory prison. I mean, excuse me, mandatory treatment, not prison. And we fund it. And we fund it, and three days doesn't get it. It takes at least  to  days to make any progress. We have to pay for that.\n",
      "Just like instead of building new prisons, we build new rehabilitation centers. We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses. You know, if you own a house, I know you do know, if you own a house in an all black neighborhood, same exact house in all white neighborhood, exact same shape, the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less, making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth, as my friend at the end of the line here says. So here's the deal: we have to do much, much more. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place, redlining, to stop it.\n",
      "I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement, I became a public defender. That's why I got involved. There's so many things we have to do across the board, and in education, at-risk schools. We should triple the funding we have for at-risk schools to provide for three, four, and five years old to go to school, not daycare. Increase the salaries of teachers, encourage more blacks to get into teaching, especially black men, because studies show when there's a black man in a school, it increases prospects significantly, and so on. There's a lot we can do, I've laid it all out as how to do, go to joebiden.com, you'll see the whole deal, including criminal justice reform.\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you Mr. Vice President. As you mentioned South Carolina, three weeks from tomorrow they'll go to the polls to vote, black voters make up about % of the electorate there. Senator Sanders, several weeks ago, Nina Turner, one of your national co-chairs, published an op-ed piece that said Vice President Biden has \"repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with Republican lawmakers and undermine our progress.\" Senator Sanders, do you agree with her, one of your most visible surrogates, that Vice President Biden has repeatedly betrayed black voters?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I think what Senator Turner was talking about are some of the early actions of Vice President Biden, but no. Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and I'm not here to attack him. But what I would say is that what we need in terms of the African American community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education, in healthcare. There is no excuse why white families in America have  times more wealth than black families. No excuse that disproportionately, African Americans are in jail compared to whites. No excuse for black women dying in childbirth three times the rate that white women are doing as well.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yes.\n",
      "DAVIS: You had raised your hand before.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yes I did, because I think in addition to the economic argument we're making here with the sad, sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in New Orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby, and % of African American kids being living in poverty, we know that there are economic solutions here, to invest in those communities, housing, childcare. But there's something else insidious going on that we haven't addressed, and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting. That is, moves across the country to limit people's right to vote, and that is why I have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn . There is no reason that we can't do that across this country. To stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state, and yes, to stop the voting purges.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Because what is going on right now in the words of one North Carolina court is that they are discriminating with surgical precision against African American voters, and we are not going to be able to get any of these things done if we don't give people the right to vote.\n",
      "DAVIS: Vice President Biden and then Senator Warren.\n",
      "BIDEN: I beg your pardon?\n",
      "DAVIS: I just wanted to give you a chance to respond.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, I agree completely. There should be registration, automatic registration, turning , you get a driver's license, whatever you do, you automatically are registered, number one. Number two, with regard to what we're going to see in South Carolina, we're all going to be there pretty soon. We'll see whether or not it works. In response to the letter that the person, I'm not saying Bernie wrote the letter, but the senator who wrote the letter was very brisk and significant with other African Americans in South Carolina taking issue with her.\n",
      "But look, Amy is right, the senator's correct. That is that we, in fact, there is systematic racism, and that's why our Justice Department works so hard to go after those. You know, realize there are  states in the United States of America that have come up with a total of  laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep African Americans from voting, and brown as well, black and brown people from voting. And that will be an enormous priority in my administration as it was in ours. It's just wrong, simply wrong.\n",
      "WARREN: I'm glad to stand on this stage with my fellow Democrats who talk about how important the black community is, at least at election time. Year after year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say \"Boy, we really care about these issues. Racism is terrible, we all want to do something,\" and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well I think it's time we have real, concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people's lives. I proposed a two cent wealth tax. And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax. We can cancel student loan debt for  million Americans, and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college, borrow more money while they're in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out, that one law is going to help close the black-white wealth gap for people with student loans by about  points.\n",
      "We aren't making a difference in America. We're saying to the rich folks \"You keep your money, and the rest of us will talk about racism but not really do anything.\" I think the time for that is over, I'm ready to get in this fight and really make a change.\n",
      "BIDEN: Okay, thank you.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Actually, let's keep this debate going. Go ahead, Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: Out of narrative comes policy. And we're talking about a lot of policies that affect Americans, broadly and disproportionately affect black Americans or brown Americans. But what I believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly. Because everyone's saying we can't have rules that are different for different people, but in fact we're here because we had rules that are different for different people. I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last  years in America of systematic racism against African Americans, not just legal discrimination, injustice, and cruelty, but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries. Because I believe out of narrative comes policy. We need to repair damage that's been done officially, and pretending we're all the same is not accurate. We got here a certain way. Let's talk about Jim Crow, let's talk about Martin Luther King, let's talk about Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland who's one of our great leaders, and then let's figure out how to repair the damage so we can move forward together.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Yang, take on that argument, also what he said about reparations.\n",
      "YANG: The median African American household net work is projected to be zero by . Things are not getting better for people of color. If anything, they're getting wore, because we're in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy. It's something of an economic unnatural disaster, and who suffers most in a natural disaster? People of color, people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education.\n",
      "And while I know we love to champion education here as Democrats, only % of Americans are going attend college, lower percentage of African Americans. There is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out African American net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and , and it's not just them, it is truck drivers, it is retail clerks, it is call center workers, it is accountants, it is bookkeepers. We are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country, and it's going to hit black people the hardest. We have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: We've been getting a lot of questions from Apple News in tonight, including many about a candidate who's not on the stage tonight, but is in this race, and that is former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York. And this question came in from Nashville, Tennessee, says \"Billionaire Michael Bloomberg has entered the race and just got the endorsement of a former Trump Navy Secretary. Why do you think you are better positioned than Bloomberg to beat Trump?\" Senator Warren.\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States. I don't think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns out to do it. I heard everyone here talking about as Democrats, we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end this unlimited spending, yeah. Except everyone on this stage except Amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending. So if you really want to live where you say, then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs.\n",
      "Look, I think the way we build a democracy going forward is not billionaires reaching in their own pockets or people sucking up to billionaires. The way we build it going forward is we have a grassroots movement funded from the grassroots up. That's the way I'm running this campaign. If you think it's the right way to run a campaign, to go elizabethwarren.com and pitch in $, because understand this: our democracy hangs in the balance. If we have to fund through billionaires, then we're just going to be an America that's going to work better and better for billionaires and not for anyone else.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar, then Senator Sanders.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: So I can't stand the big money in politics, and one of my major focuses is going to be on passing that constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. I didn't come from money, and I just simply think people don't look at the guy in the White House and say \"Can we get someone richer?\" I don't think they think that. They want to have someone that they can understand. And you know my background. My grandpa was an iron ore miner, he worked  feet underground in the mines his whole life. He couldn't even graduate from high school because he had to raise his nine brothers and sisters. My grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to a two year community college. That was my family's trust, and you can't send, like Donald Trump got from his family, you can't fit $ million in a coffee can.\n",
      "My mom grew up and wanted to be a teacher in Wisconsin. She moved to Minnesota, she taught second grade until she was  years old. And no, I am not a billionaire, but I stand before you today as granddaughter of an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, the first woman elected to the US Senate from the state of Minnesota, someone who has passed over  bills as a lead Democrat in that gridlock in Washington, DC, and that is because we live in a country of shared dreams. And that means no matter where you come from, no matter where you come from, you should be able to make it. So please help me in my efforts at amyklobuchar.com.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Everybody's getting the fundraising pitches out here.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: This is a campaign of real people.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Right now, Senator Sanders, I am coming to you, but Mayor Bloomberg is-\n",
      "SANDERS: Let's talk about money, and let's talk about-\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: … Let me just put the question to you, because Mayor Bloomberg has taken on your argument-\n",
      "SANDERS: … I've got to answer before the question, it's more …\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: … he says we need evolution, not revolution.\n",
      "SANDERS: I couldn't hear that.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Bloomberg has said we need evolution, not revolution, taking you on directly.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, it's a funny thing. There are millions of people who can desire to run for office, but I guess if you're work $ billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials, you have a slight advantage. That is nonsense. What we have got to do is have a nation in which we not only overturn Citizens United, we move to public funding of election.\n",
      "In terms of money in politics, our campaign, and I am enormously proud of this, unlike some of the folks up here, I don't have  billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign, coming from the pharmaceutical industry, coming from Wall Street, and all the big money interests. What we do have is we have now over six million contributions from one and a half million people averaging $. a contribution. That is unprecedented in the history of American politics. If we want to change America, you're not going to do it be electing candidates who are going out to rich people's homes begging for money. The way we're going to do it is build a mass movement of working people who are prepared to stand up, not take money from these billionaires, not take money from Wall Street, but stand up to the drug companies and Wall Street. And if you want to be part of that political revolution, berniesanders.com.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg, close this round out.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We are going into the fight of our lives. Donald Trump, according to news reports, and his allies raised $ million today. We need to go into that fight with everything that we've got. Now I've been very clear on both my record, where I have sued pharmaceutical companies, and what I'm campaigning for, that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire, I know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of South Bend, Indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse.\n",
      "We are here without the involvement of any corporate PACs because hundreds of thousands of people went to, yes, peteforamerica.com, contributed to this campaign, and let me say something else. If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here, we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump. And in order to do that, we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject, but how we bring everybody into the fold. And if you are low-income, or if you're able to contribute a lot. If you've always voted Democrat, or if you're an Independent or even a Republican who's just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House, we need you to join us right now. I will not pursue politics by telling people they can't be at our side if they're not with us % of the time. This is a time for addition, not rejection, for belonging, not exclusion.\n",
      "MUIR: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. I want to turn to climate change and jobs here in America. President Trump just signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, many call it an updated NAFTA. But it odes include incentives to make cars here in North America and it does open Canadian markets for American dairy farmers. Senator Sanders, as we sit here in New Hampshire tonight, both New Hampshire senators Maggie Hassan and Senator Jeanne Shaheen supported this, calling it a real win for workers and for farmers. You voted no, because you said you believe it takes us back years on climate. Were the senators from New Hampshire wrong?\n",
      "SANDERS: Yes. I mean, it's a disagreement, but if you look at every environmental group in this country, including the Sunrise organization, we're so proud to have their support, because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal I think ever authored by a presidential candidate. But they are saying, what the environmental groups are saying, we're simply exporting fossil fuel emissions to Mexico. There is not one word in that trade agreement …\n",
      "There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I don't know how in  you can do that. Second of all, there is, in terms of outsourcing of jobs, a major crisis in this country. Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico, where workers are paid in some cases less than $ an hour. So I think the right vote was the vote against that agreement. I don't apologize for that.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, thank you. I do want to go to Senator Klobuchar. You've heard what Senator Sanders just said there. He said not one word on climate in the trade deal. So why did you vote yes?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, I want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, who work so hard for this state every day and I voted with them. Why did I vote with them? Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections, when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change, I think we have to have a North American trading block. We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president, yes, I'll work to make this a part of every future trade agreement, but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement, which I will do on day one.\n",
      "It is bringing back the clean power rules. It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that, and in future trade agreements, that should be part of our negotiations. But I'm telling you right now, having no trade agreement with Canada and Mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China and pushing China to do better when it comes to climate change.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar, thank you. Senator Warren, you voted yes as well.\n",
      "WARREN: Yes I did, and I'll tell you why, because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of Donald Trump's trade policies. There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they can't get enforcement of any workers' rights. So this NAFTA provision, after a lot of negotiation with Democrats, Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better. This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country, I'm saying, I'll sign up for that and then I'll get up tomorrow morning and I'll start working hard for a better trade deal on climate, a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it. Everyone wants to get to the American market. We should be raising standards on climate around the world to get access to our market.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: Yeah, I got to agree with Bernie Sanders, I do. Senator Warren is right. Everybody wants to get into our market, and that's how we convince them that they've got to be right on climate too. That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way. Yeah, of course, we want to make things better for American workers, and it's absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy, we're thinking about it from the point of view of the American people, not of the American corporations. That's a huge positive change. And I agree with the senators on that, but there's something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy. We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani, and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world.\n",
      "So if we actually want to be the leaders of the world, the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks, that makes a difference, we're going to have to put climate first, and when we think about doing the wrong thing, the way Mr. Trump did with General Soleimani, we have to ask, does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing? It absolutely does not.\n",
      "Being all by ourselves, being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world. So in fact, the USMCA is something, that's the first step, but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying. Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers, but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things aren't always exactly how you would do them. But in this case, if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends, and I would agree, he always sides with tyrants over innocents. He always sides with dictators over allies, but I think you've got to have some friends and those two countries, our neighbors, may not be perfect, but they are our friends, and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough.\n",
      "He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong. He blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself. He blames the King of Denmark, who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone , who does that? That's what Donald Trump does. So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies, and New Hampshire is such a great example of this, New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen, who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state, but a state that is a piece of the world. We cannot be alone, and that trade agreement was not perfect, but the point of it is, if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world, we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nation's security.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: All right. Senator Klobuchar, thanks very much. We have hit the two hour mark, we need to take a quick break and come back for the final question.\n",
      "DWYER: Welcome back to Manchester, New Hampshire and the ABC News Democratic Debate. Thanks for joining us here on ABC News Live tonight. I'm Devin Dwyer, joined with our political correspondent, Rachel Scott. Rachel, we heard so much this last block about gun policy, abortion, climate change, and then the issue of race, pushed on by Tom Steyer and really a lot of the candidates confronting Joe Biden, a sign of where this campaign is headed.\n",
      "SCOTT: Exactly, Devin. Steyer tonight calling out the lack of discussion when it comes to race on that stage, the conversation turning  minutes into this debate and Biden touting what the national polls reflect. His loyalty among African American voters. I have sat down with the vice president, he has told me it's one of the things that he is most proud of, his loyalty among black supporters, and if you want to just see how important black voters are to the democratic base, all you have to look at are the numbers from , the exit polls from that primary,  out of  voters in Mississippi were black, % of voters in the South Carolina primary were black, and that's where the candidates are going to be heading very soon ahead of that.\n",
      "DWYER: And to Nevada as well with a lot of voters of color there and Joe Biden holding a lion's share of those voters. We'll see if these candidates can chip away. You know, we were talking so many of the policies we heard about tonight, like so many of the previous debates, are familiar positions from these candidates, which is why the style of their performance tonight is going to get a lot of attention from voters.\n",
      "SCOTT: It will, but you know, when I talk to voters as I travel the country, they tell me their number one concern is electability. They want someone that could be President Trump, they want someone that could carry this over the finish line and that's why you hear so much of the session pitting back to who can do that on that stage today.\n",
      "DWYER: I was up in Derry, New Hampshire just yesterday hearing not only a lot of attention on those qualities of style, but also a lot of anxiety over this issue of electability particularly now with Donald Trump's polling numbers on the rise, his performance at the State of the Union and his acquittal in that Senate trial. It's going to be a four day sprint, I know you're going to be out there all weekend as I will as well and we were just talking about what this moment in this campaign will mean. We could see a dramatically smaller field after Tuesday night here in New Hampshire.\n",
      "SCOTT: Tom Perez came out here and he said, listen, we are beginning a  day sprint. Most of the delegates are going to be grabbed up by the end of this  days and the candidates really have to hone in on their pitch here. The voting has started, already. We're moving into the New Hampshire primary and a lot of these candidates have a lot on the line here. They only have a few days left to gain momentum before that next vote is cast, and again, this race is getting tighter and tighter.\n",
      "DWYER: And we know Donald Trump will be here in New Hampshire and Manchester as well, on Monday. So things are going to get a little even more exciting four days ahead of the New Hampshire primaries. We had back now for the final question in this ABC News Democratic Debate. Take a look at the speaking times of the candidates. We'll leave you with that. Joe Biden, top of the list, all the candidates back at their podiums. Stay with us right here on ABC News Live.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Welcome back to our debate, time now for a final question. Each of you will answer it in turn. We'll start with Mr.Yang, and the question is this. According to the Children's Defense Fund, it's been more than  years since child poverty was directly addressed in a presidential debate. The year was  the question was our friend and former [inaudible] who may be watching right now, the late Cokie Roberts.\n",
      "Cokie loved the New Hampshire primary, and she asked the candidates in this Republican debate, how will we overcome the scandal of one quarter of American preschoolers living in poverty in the richest nation on earth? Today, nearly one in five American preschoolers are still living below the poverty line, even though we've had  straight years of economic growth. What does that say to you about where America is today and what we need to do about it?\n",
      "YANG: George, we're in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country, and unfortunately, that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger, smarter, more capable all the time, and most of us are not. Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day. So if we want to alleviate child poverty, we need to put money directly into the hands of families, particularly single parents, % of American children today are born to single moms, % of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth.\n",
      "What is the market value my wife, Evelyn had, or stay at home parents around the country? Zero. Caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones, like Kyle Christensen in Iowa? Zero. Volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive? Zero. Coaches and mentors helping our kids? Zero. Most artists, sorry artists, but it's true. Zero. Increasingly local journalists, which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you can't vote on something if you actually don't have any news coverage. The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value, say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans. That we each have intrinsic value as citizens, as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: The problem is, America's been counting the wrong things. Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. I'm sure if you've got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you. But the problem is, we've had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need, or even so many in the middle.\n",
      "When I'm president, we're going to measure the performance of our economy, not by the Dow Jones but by the income growth of the %, because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty. Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate, in particular, the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have. This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change. The American people, not just die hard Democrats, but so many Independents and some Republicans, think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesn't happen. That is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics. To turn the page, leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren.\n",
      "WARREN: So I started my grownup life as a special education teacher. I learned early on about the worth of every single human being, and I believe that the best investment we can make as a nation, the best investment we can make as human beings, is to invest in our children. We've had enough of making rhetoric around this. Everyone says they love the kids, but here's the deal. It's time to come up with real plans to make that happen. I've talked before about a two cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.\n",
      "We want to have a real future in this country, then invest in our children. Don't leave public education just to our localities in our states. Be a good federal partner. Put real money into our schools, put real money into housing, put real money into into healthcare. Put real money into the future of our children. That's how we build the America of our best values.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: I come from a family where our dad walked in one day and said, we've got to move. Don't have a job. We've got to move to a different city. I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others, who go through the same thing where the father's made that longest walk or the mother's made that longest walk. I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress. My net worth was net zero a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that I've never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years. It's not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others, but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here.\n",
      "These aren't someone else's children. They're all our children. They're the kite strings that lift our national ambitions, they really are. They lift our national ambitions aloft. We have an overwhelming interest, overwhelming interest in seeing to it they do well. You know,  out of every  students in school today, from grade school to high school, are Latino. What are we going to do? Walk away from that?\n",
      "Many of them come from homes that are poor, very poor. That's why I invest so much time and energy in preschool. That's why if I only have $ to spend, I spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day, than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating. A great number of them, as Mr. Yang said, aren't going on to college, although I think we should help with college. They're not going on to college. What they're going to do, they're going to be equipped to compete in the st century by training them for the new trades, the new opportunities, the new capabilities that are out there. We must focus on our children. Like I said, they're all our children, they're not somebody else's kids. Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, as my father would say, is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and we're not doing it.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, disproportionately high for the African American community, by the way, is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations. Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America.\n",
      "The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases  times more than other countries for prescription drugs, and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the % and by wealthy campaign contributors. Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country. What is unique about our campaign, is we say, unashamedly, we are raising our campaign contributions, not from billionaires but from working class people. That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run. It is time to take on the big money interests. It is time to change our national priorities. Thank you.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: In Cokie's memory, let me answer this question. We may have lost an election in , Democrats, but we did not lose hope. And there is a way, it's actually based on a National Academy of Science report and I've used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in  years and eradicate it in a generation. We can do it with investment in childcare. We can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done. But to get it done, we have to be able to reach those voters that we lost in this state and across the country.\n",
      "There's an old story of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and when he died, his body was put on a train and went up across America and there was a guy standing by those tracks along with so many Americans, and he had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and a reporter said, Sir, did you know the president? And the guy says, no, I didn't know the president, but he knew me. He knew me. I will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now. I will bring that to you.\n",
      "If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent. I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you're going to pay for your childcare or your longterm care, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble figuring out if you're going to fill your refrigerator or fill your prescription drug, I know you and I will fight for you. I do not have the biggest name up on this stage. I don't have the biggest bank account. I'm not a political newcomer with no record, but I have a record of fighting for people. I'm asking you to join us@amyklobuchar.com. I'm asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in America can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me, Please, New Hampshire, I would love your vote and I would love the vote of America. Thank you.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: The Republicans have a cruel plan and their plan is pretty simple. It's to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids, by cutting healthcare across the board, by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want, and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement. It's very simple. That's what Mr. Trump's plan is and it's true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country. It's not just that he does bad things. He doesn't understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it. So in fact, what we need to do is have a new conception, a new dream of America, dream it and make it happen. Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together. We are in perilous times. I am asking for your vote. Let's rise together.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates. Thank you. Thanks for a great debate tonight. Thanks to our audience here at Saint Anselm College. Thanks for our partners, WMUR and Apple News and now I'd like to send it to my colleague Martha Raddatz.\n",

      ":Wolf Blitzer (CNN);Brianne Pfannenstiel (The Des Moines Register); andAbby Phillip (CNN)\n",
      "BLITZER: Live from Drake University in Iowa, this is the CNN Democratic presidential debate, in partnership with the Des Moines Register. We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, along with CNN's Abby Phillip and the Des Moines Register's chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.\n",
      "PHILLIP: The top six Democratic presidential candidates are in place. This is their final debate before the first votes of the  presidential campaign. The Iowa caucuses are  days away.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive  seconds to answer questions,  seconds for responses and rebuttals, and  seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.\n",
      "BLITZER: All right, so let's begin right now. Just this month, the United States and Iran were on the brink of war, which has reignited the debate over America's role in the world and which of you is best prepared to be commander-in-chief. So let's have the debate right now.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, why are you best prepared -- the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?\n",
      "SANDERS: Yes, I think my record speaks to that, Wolf. In , when the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And I not only voted against the war, I helped lead the effort against that war.\n",
      "Just last year, I helped, for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia, was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it. We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues.\n",
      "I am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.\n",
      "BLITZER: Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war. Why are you the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?\n",
      "BIDEN: I said  years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn't get inspectors into Iraq to stop what -- thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake, and I acknowledged that.\n",
      "But right -- the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama, picked me to be his vice president. And once we -- once we were elected president, he turned -- and vice president, he turned to me and asked me to end that war.\n",
      "I know what it's like to send a son or daughter, like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq, and that's why I do it very, very reluctantly. That's why I led the effort, as you know, Wolf, against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interests of the United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq. And it was a mistaken vote.\n",
      "But I think my record overall on everything we've done has been -- I'm -- I'm prepared to compare it to anybody on this stage.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden's vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake. So you both acknowledged mistakes. Why should the American people trust your judgment more?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, it's a little bit of a difference. On that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself, voted for it. Only Barbara Lee voted against it.\n",
      "But what I understood right away, in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost , brave troops. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died. We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into health care and education and infrastructure in this country.\n",
      "Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.\n",
      "BLITZER: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: I was asked to bring , troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in.\n",
      "The world, in fact, voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake. And from that point on, I've voted to -- I moved to bring those troops home.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Klobuchar, you've publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg's experience when it comes to being commander-in-chief. Why is your time as a U.S. senator more valuable than his time as a U.S. naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan and as mayor?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Wolf. And I have been very clear that I respect the mayor's experience very much in the military. I just have different experience.\n",
      "I've been in the U.S. Senate for over  years. And I think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life-and-death issues and who has made decisions.\n",
      "I will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn't in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home.\n",
      "Then I have dealt with every issue, from Afghanistan to keeping our troops with good health care after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with our education and with their jobs and also with their health care.\n",
      "I think right now what we should be talking about, though, Wolf, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution. We just found out today that four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say: You must have an authorization of military force if you're going to go to war with Iran.\n",
      "That is so important, because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I worked on for a significant period of time. As president, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath...\n",
      "BLITZER: Thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: ... to protect and defend our Constitution.\n",
      "BLITZER: Thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: And I will mean it.\n",
      "BLITZER: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We're going to continue talking about who's best prepared to be commander-in-chief. Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after /, on the war in Iraq. And there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates.\n",
      "The next president is going to be confronted with national security challenges different in scope and in kind from anything we've seen before, not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. It's going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past. And for me, those lessons of the past are personal.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Warren, in our new CNN-Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours. Why are you best prepared to be commander-in-chief?\n",
      "WARREN: I believe the principal job of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. And I think that's about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world.\n",
      "I've been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I've been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops, to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they've been promised, that they don't get cheated by giant financial institutions.\n",
      "You know, I have three brothers who were in the military, and I know how much our military families sacrifice. But I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money.\n",
      "We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door, and we need to cut our defense budget.\n",
      "We need to depend on all of our tools -- diplomatic, economic, working with our allies -- and not let the defense industry call the shots.\n",
      "BLITZER: Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office. Why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as commander-in-chief?\n",
      "STEYER: I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with businesses, and I understand how America interacts with other countries.\n",
      "And you asked what is the reason that the -- the experience really counts, and to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point. It isn't so much about experience, it's about judgment.\n",
      "If you've been listening to this, what we are hearing is  years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment.\n",
      "And if you look who had the judgment, it was a state senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a congresswoman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress.\n",
      "So I would say to you this: An outside perspective, looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we're looking for now. I agree with Senator Warren. We are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we're spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget, and it's time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we're trying to do and how to do it.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all U.S. troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you've called for, as well. Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and, indeed, around the world. How would you prevent that from happening again?\n",
      "SANDERS: OK, I'm going to tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else. [laughter]\n",
      "And that is -- and I don't know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not. Maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes were the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. Both of those wars were based on lies. And right now, what I fear very much is we have a president who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.\n",
      "To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together, and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.\n",
      "BLITZER: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world, including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us. And it was working. It was working. It was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon.\n",
      "And look what's happened. He went ahead -- and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happen. We're now isolated. We're in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence.\n",
      "We have lost our standing in the region. We have lost the support of our allies. The next president has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances, and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.\n",
      "BLITZER: So just to be clear, Vice President Biden, would you leave troops in the Middle East or would you pull them out?\n",
      "BIDEN: I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we have -- where we are now, small numbers of troops, and I think it's a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS.\n",
      "What's happened is, now that he's gone ahead, the president, and started this whole process moving, what's happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We're in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region. And quite frankly, I think he's flat-out lied about saying the reason he went after -- the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Klobuchar, what's your response?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home.\n",
      "I would do that. Some would remain for counterterrorism and training.\n",
      "In Syria, I would not have removed the  troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now, I would leave our troops there, despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump.\n",
      "At the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also asked them what their alternatives were. And they gave very vague, vague answers.\n",
      "I asked them, where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was president? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people. Time and time again, you see that this president puts his own interests, his private interests, in front of our country's. I would put our country's interests first as commander-in- chief.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East, or bring them home?\n",
      "WARREN: No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on Earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take. But we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. Our keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools.\n",
      "Now, look, I understand, there are people on this stage, when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about  more years,  more years. Shoot, Lindsey Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region.\n",
      "BLITZER: Vice President Biden, is Senator Warren right?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, I tell you what, there's a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition to put together  countries to deal with stateless terror as well as failed states. Not us alone,  other countries.\n",
      "That's how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.\n",
      "BLITZER: Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan. Who's right?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what's going on right now is the president's actually sending more. The very president who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along -- although we know that's not true -- now has more troops going to the Middle East.\n",
      "And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members. I remember walking with a friend of mine, another lieutenant I trained with, as we walked away, and his one-and-a-half-year-old boy was toddling after him, not understanding why his father wasn't turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had not to turn around and look at his boy one more time.\n",
      "That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm's way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander-in-chief.\n",
      "BLITZER: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Eighty-seven million people have no health care or are uninsured or underinsured. We got , people sleeping out on the streets tonight.\n",
      "The American people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State Department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.\n",
      "BLITZER: We're going to get to everyone, but, Vice President Biden, you criticized President Trump's decision to kill the Iranian general, Soleimani, without first going to Congress. Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?\n",
      "BIDEN: I ran the first time as a -year-old kid against the war in Vietnam on the grounds that the only way to take a nation to war is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people.\n",
      "And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, including special forces, we -- there's no way you negotiate or have been able to negotiate with terrorists.\n",
      "You have to be able to form coalitions to be able to defeat them or contain them. If you don't, we end up being the world's policeman again.\n",
      "They're going to come to us. They've come to us before. They'll come to us again. So it's a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries. It's fundamentally the requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.\n",
      "BLITZER: Mr. Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action. So would the Biden doctrine be different?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress, House, and Senate, and signed by the president. That was the authority. It does not give authority to go into Iran. It gave authority to deal with these other issues.\n",
      "BLITZER: Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: That authorization needs to be replaced.\n",
      "BIDEN: Exactly. And we tried to.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: When we lost troops in Niger, there were members of Congress who admitted they didn't even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaida and /. And often, Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now, thanks to Democrats in Congress, that's changing. But the reality is, year after year, Congress didn't want to touch this, either, because it was so politically difficult.\n",
      "Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm's way, often on deployment after deployment, then we've got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up- or-down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am president, anytime -- which I hope will never happen -- but anytime I am compelled to use force and seek that authorization, we will have a three-year sunset, so that the American people are included...\n",
      "BLITZER: Thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: ... not only in the decision about whether to send troops, but whether to continue.\n",
      "BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Warren -- we're going to get to everyone -- but, Senator Warren, what about you? Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?\n",
      "WARREN: Well, imminent threat. But we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the Constitution provides and that is what as commander-in-chief I will do.\n",
      "But I just want to be clear. Everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war. But the question is, when and how do you plan to get out of it?\n",
      "You know, on the Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, you know, we've just turned the corner and now it's all going to be different. And then what happens? It's all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we've just turned the corner.\n",
      "We've turned the corner so many times, we're going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It's not enough to say some day we're going to get out. No one on the ground, none of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It's time to get our combat troops home.\n",
      "BLITZER: Mr. Steyer, would a President Steyer use military force as a deterrent? And if not, under what circumstances would you take military action?\n",
      "STEYER: I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows is that there is no real strategy that we're trying to accomplish in what we're doing in the Middle East.\n",
      "Obviously, Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis, from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last  years, including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that, in fact, there was no strategy. There was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.\n",
      "So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden. To do it, we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that, as we do that, we're confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about.\n",
      "But at the same time, there's a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value-driven coalition-building that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we should do should follow into that strategy. And it's just not happening in Washington, D.C.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you'd face as president is the threat of nuclear weapons. Last week, President Trump said, quote, \"As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\" Would a President Buttigieg make that same promise?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons will, of course, be a priority, because it's such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal.\n",
      "By gutting the Iran nuclear deal -- one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran -- by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.\n",
      "Now -- yes?\n",
      "PHILLIP: Continue.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: In order to get that done, we've got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA. That first letter \"J\" stood for \"Joint.\" We can't do this alone, even less so now after everything that has happened.\n",
      "Which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world, and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear-armed country.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, to be clear, would you allow Iran to become a nuclear power, yes or no?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, we've got a lot of other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world.\n",
      "Despite this president's coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. We've got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from states, from stateless potential terrorist actors, or anywhere else around the world.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Senator Klobuchar, if you become president, it's very possible there won't be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin. Given that, how would you prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I would start negotiations again. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting -- Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.\n",
      "So what I would do is negotiate. I would bring people together, just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a president that sees this as a number-one goal.\n",
      "And in answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place. I think there are changes you can make to the agreement that are sunset, some changes to the inspections, but overall, that is what we should do.\n",
      "And I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran, because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen: enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea. President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times. President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions. Would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, not now. I wouldn't meet with them without any preconditions. Look, what -- we gave him everything he's looking for, legitimacy. The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.\n",
      "I would be putting what I did as vice president -- I met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make -- their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before -- and you reported it extensively, Wolf -- about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons, that we would -- and when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, that's a threat to us, I said, we're going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.\n",
      "I would reignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea, and I would put enormous pressure, enormous pressure on China, because that's also in their interests for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist. But I would not, I would not meet with -- absent preconditions, I would not meet with the, quote, \"Supreme Leader,\" who said Joe Biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick. I count that...\n",
      "SANDERS: Other than that, you like him?\n",
      "BIDEN: Other than that, I like him, and he -- he...[laughter]\n",
      "And he got a love letter from Trump right after that.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mr. Steyer, would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?\n",
      "STEYER: No. It's very clear that if we're going to do something with North Korea, we're going to have to do it in concert with our allies, that meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get.\n",
      "But this is a classic situation where the United States' idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let's face it. Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we've had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran, whereas, in fact, what worked with President Obama was an alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That, to me, is called strategy. Having a goal to make America safer, by looking more broadly...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n",
      "STEYER: ... than just us, as the policeman of the world spending money.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Let's stay with the theme of America's role in the world and talk about trade. Tomorrow, President Trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with China. And the Senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Iowa's largest trading partners.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, you have said that new deal, the USMCA, quote, \"makes some modest improvements,\" yet you are going to vote against it. Aren't modest improvements better than no improvements...\n",
      "SANDERS: No, we can do much...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: ... for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in Iowa?\n",
      "SANDERS: The answer is we could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal. This deal -- and I think the proponents of it acknowledge -- will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs as a result of outsourcing.\n",
      "The heart and soul of our disastrous trade agreements -- and I'm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China -- is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, $ or $ an hour.\n",
      "Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase \"climate change\" in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: But, Senator Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal. Are you unwilling to compromise?\n",
      "SANDERS: The AFL-CIO does. The Machinists Union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it.\n",
      "So I happen to believe -- and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment -- if we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our children -- and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: We're going to get to climate change, but I'd like to stay on trade. Senator Warren...\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, they are the same in this issue.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Senator Warren, you support the USMCA. Why is Senator Sanders wrong?\n",
      "WARREN: I do. I wasn't here. I haven't been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe, because I didn't think it was in the interests of the American people, the American workers, or environmental interests.\n",
      "But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting. And they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut really don't have enforcement on workers' rights.\n",
      "This new trade deal is a modest improvement. Senator Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers. It will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help, and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal.\n",
      "We need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just to trade policy written for big, international companies. I'm ready to have that fight, but let's help the people who need help right now.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you. Senator Sanders, can you please respond to Senator Warren?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years.\n",
      "Senator Warren is right in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that -- it is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. That is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is, I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations behind doors.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to bring you in here.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Brianne, I want to hit reality here. I serve on the Agriculture Committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa -- and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are -- and I went to this plant and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump's trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard. That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms and he said, these are my friends, they don't work anymore. And their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador. And that guy started to cry.\n",
      "These are real people hurt by Donald Trump's trade war. So what we should do, and I support the USMCA, I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown on labor and environment and on pharma, the sweetheart deal...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: ... because I think we need a big trading block...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: ... with North America to take on China. And the way you are stronger...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Senator Klobuchar, your time is up.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: ... China is with our allies.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg, do you support the USMCA, yes or no?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, it has been improved, it is not perfect. But when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA.\n",
      "But let's acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration. You know, my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the 's, selling trade deals, telling us, don't worry about your slice of the pie, the pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off. And that promise was broken.\n",
      "The part about the pie getting bigger happened. It's just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not. That is why there is such frustration, the sense that these decisions in boardrooms...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: ... and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what's best for us...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: ... but based on their own gain.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders has said that Donald Trump will, quote, \"eat your lunch\" for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements. When it comes to trade, why are you the best candidate to take on President Trump?\n",
      "BIDEN: There will be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalists and labor at the table. And there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers. We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing American workers to compete in the st Century on the high-tech side, dealing with all artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that.\n",
      "And by the way, the idea -- I don't know that there's any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that  percent of the customers are out there. So we better figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement here, in case you haven't noticed. And that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone. And that is to increase the profits of large multi-national corporations.

      "BIDEN: We need corporate responsibility and I agree with that completely. But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we make. Enforceable agreements. That's one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico. And that's what we should be doing in any agreement we have.\n",
      "But let's get back to the basics here. If we don't set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our eye -- excuse me, poking our finger in the eye of all of our friends and allies, we make up  percent of the world's economy. We've got to bring the other  percent of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things, using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage.\n",

      "WARREN: You know, our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. It has been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had this strategy for decades.\n",
      "And that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multi-national corporation lobbyists and corporate executives, who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multi-national corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment.\n",
      "We need a different approach to trade and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market.

      "STEYER: Look, on the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump's tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners, so that not having to use corn- based ethanol.\n",

      "So let me say this. I'm the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority. I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can't sign a deal, even if it's marginally better for working people until climate is also taken into consideration.\n",

      "We cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say we're going to sign this one more deal, we're going to do one more thing without putting climate first. That's why it's my number one priority. We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg, your response?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, that's right. This issue is personal for me. It's why we're going to tackle climate from day one. It's why we've got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today. Now, what I've noticed is, pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now.\n",
      "The question is, how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades.

      "SANDERS: Well, what I will tell you is Medicare For All, which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo.\n",
      "Medicare For All will end the absurdity of the United States paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general, while we have  million uninsured -- uninsured and underinsured, and while , people die each year.\n",
      "Under Medicare For All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a  percent tax on income, exempting the first $,. So the average family in America that today makes $, would pay $, a year, compared to that family paying $, a year. We save money, comprehensive health care, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exists in our dysfunctional system.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Vice President Biden, does Senator Sanders owe voters a price tag on his health care plan?\n",
      "BIDEN: I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we're going to do and what it's going to cost. And a  percent tax on income over $, doesn't even come close to paying for between $ trillion, and some estimates as high as $ trillion over  years.\n",
      "That's doubling the entire federal budget per year. There's a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, reinstate -- rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and in fact make sure that we, in the process, reduce the cost of -- of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the -- subsidize it further, and make it everybody -- available to everyone.\n",

      "This debate isn't real. I was in Vegas the other day and someone said \"Don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.\"\n",

I'll just pick one:  million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription, this is what they needed to get well, and they couldn't afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said it's either groceries or this prescription.\n",
      "My approach to this is we've got to get as much as help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one thin dime.\n",
      "What I can do are the things I can do as president on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I'll use the power that's already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV-AIDS drugs. Let's get some relief to those families. And I will defend the Affordable Care Act.\n",
      "I've got a plan to expand health care, but let's keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do health care, but we're going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut health care for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I'll take our side of the argument any day. We're going to beat him on this.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Warren. Vice President Biden? [applause]\n",
      "BIDEN: The proposal I lay out does, in fact, limit drug cost. It sets up — it allows all the drug companies — excuse me, it allows you to — Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation.

Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for health care as any other advanced country in the world. And it makes no sense and the government has to step in.\n",
      "I do happen to agree with Vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option. But the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.\n",

      "SANDERS: No, our plan wouldn't bankrupt the country. And, in fact, it would much improve the well-being of working-class families and the middle class.\n",
      "Let us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us  times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.\n",
      "What we will do through a Medicare for all single-payer program is substantially lower the cost of health care for employers and workers, because we end the $ billion a year that the health care industry makes and the $ billion a year we spend in administrative — the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.\n",

      "PHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, you're selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it, yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don't want it, and force them to pay for it. How is that truth in advertising?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look, the individual mandate was an important part of the ACA because the system doesn't work if there are free riders.\n",
      "What I'm offering is a choice. You don't have to be in my plan if there's another plan that you would rather keep. And there's no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver health care for all.\n",
      "And my plan is paid for. Look, our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. Now, we've got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, it's almost invariably Republican presidents who have added to the deficit, a trillion dollars under this president. And it's why everything I've put forward — from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we're going to make in infrastructure to dealing with climate change — is fully paid for.\n",
      "When it comes to health care, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $. trillion over a decade. No small sum. But not the $ trillion, $ trillion, $ trillion that we're hearing about from the others. All you've got to do is two things, both of them are commonsense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn't even need it.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Sen. Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: So I started this by talking about  million Americans, including Americans with insurance, who just can't even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, health care plans that we have, and these plans are paid for.\n",
      "The problem is that plans like the mayor's and like the vice president's is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. But they're a small improvement. And that's why it is that they cost so much less, because by themselves, they're not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for  million people who can't afford to get them filled.\n",
      "What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top  percent, to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes, we can have them pay. And we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide health care for all our people.\n",
      "Yes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer health care to all of our people. And we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small. We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate.\n",
      "This would be a game-changer. This would be the biggest thing we've done to American health care in a half-century. Let's measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives.\n",
      "And, yes, we're taking on cost. On prescription drugs, we'll have an out-of-pocket cap, even if you don't get the subsidies that would make it free, a $ monthly cap. And here's why it's got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they've got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits?\n",
      "It makes no sense medically because most of us don't experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don't come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly.\n",

      "PHILLIP: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Sen. Warren, your response?\n",
      "WARREN: Look, the numbers that the mayor is offering just don't add up. The average family in America last year paid $, in some combination of deductibles and co-pays and uncovered expenses and fees. You can't cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about.\n",
      "The way we have to approach this is we've got to build this and we've got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families.\n",
      "But we have to be willing to work together. We can let people experience what health care is like when it's you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner, with no insurance company standing in the middle.\n",

      "PHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Sen. Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all — that you couldn't get there right away. You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn't get on it, that you would kick  million Americans off their current health insurance. Then, a few months ago, you said, no, you're going to wait a while to get there.\n",
      "And I think that was some acknowledgment that maybe what we're talking about is true. And I don't buy that it's not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $, that your premiums will be cut in half, which is what the nonprofit public option will do.\n",
      "And as you talk, Mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have  cosponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can't negotiate for better prices for our seniors.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Senator...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I will get it done.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, coming to you now. CNN reached out to Iowa Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Edward from here in Des Moines writes, \"Des Moines is an insurance town. What happens to all the insurance industry — the health insurance industry here if there is Medicare for all? What happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like Des Moines?\"\n",
      "SANDERS: We build in to our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and health care and job training for those people.\n",
      "But here is the issue. Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases,  times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is: the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies.\n",
      "And if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people health care is a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do? We are finally going to have to stand up to the health care industry...\n",
      "STEYER: Can I respond to this?\n",
      "SANDERS: ... and end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mr. Steyer?\n",
      "STEYER: I just want to emphasize what Sen. Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders said, it's clear. There are two problems. We're spending way too much because corporations own the system and we're not negotiating against those corporations.\n",
      "And we've given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That's all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering.\n",
      "Sen. Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we're going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That's why I'm for term limits. We need to redo Washington, D.C., and...\n",
      "PHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: ... actually take back the government from the corporations who've bought it.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five — five Democratic presidents couldn't get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal.\n",
      "Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices. You don't have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If, in fact, they charge more than we set the price for, they can — they can, in fact — we can — people can import from abroad, assuming that it is — it is — it is safe.\n",
      "We, in fact — it's only yellow, Wolf, OK? And we can, in fact, do all of this and still provide people the option to stay — the roughly  to  million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers. If they don't like it, or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.\n",
      "BLITZER: Let's talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now. Prescription drug prices in , Americans spent $ billion on prescription drugs alone. That's about $ billion more than they paid a decade ago.\n",
      "Sen. Warren, you've called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike. Why does it make sense for the government — for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows?\n",
      "WARREN: So, let's do this both ways. What I also have said is, I'm just going to use the power that is available and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin.\n",
      "We already have the legal authority with the president to do that. The president just hasn't picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV-AIDS drugs. That's going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately.\n",
      "But, you know, there are a whole lot of drugs, about  percent of drugs, that are not under patent. They're generic drugs. But the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up.\n",
      "So my view is, let's give them a little competition. The government lets contracts for all kind of things. They let contracts to build buildings. They let contracts to build military weapons. Let's let the contracts out. Put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices.\n",
      "This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don't have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.\n",
      "BLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first. Number one, I mention the Medicare negotiation. Number two, I have a plan,  things I've found that a president can do herself in the first  days without Congress — that are legal. [laughter]\n",
      "And one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries. Bernie and I had an amendment on this. We got  Republican votes on it. It was at midnight. They might have not known what they were voting for. But we got that. [laughter]\n",
      "I now have an actual bill with Sen. Grassley that does that. And I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market.\n",
      "The issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of the Congress.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: They think they own Washington. They don't own me.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: And as president, I will get this done.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: We're going to turn now to childcare, a huge expense for many new families and a problem that's especially acute in rural Iowa. We have another question for an Iowa Democratic voter.\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes, as a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two-thirds of my income. Many families don't have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly, as we've seen in Iowa over the last few years. How will you prioritize accessing quality, affordable child care in your first  days in office?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: It makes no sense for childcare to cost two-thirds of somebody's income. We've to drive it to  percent or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty.\n",
      "But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they're working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense, and it must change, and we shouldn't be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality.\n",
      "Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education, as well as childcare writ large. We can do that.\n",
      "And until we do, this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap. Because when somebody like the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare. Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning?\n",
      "WARREN: No, actually, my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment.\n",
      "But understand this about the plan. I've been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom. I had two little kids, and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited. But it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another, and it just didn't work.\n",
      "If I hadn't been saved by my Aunt Bee — I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on, how many of my daughter's generation get knocked off the track and don't get back on, how many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on.\n",
      "I have a two cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children, and provide universal pre-K for every -year-old and -year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. That's an investment in our babies. That's an investment in their mamas and their daddies. And it's an investment in our teachers and in our economy.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Sanders, will your... [applause]\n",
      "WARREN: It's what we need to do.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: ... universal childcare program be free for everyone regardless of income?\n",
      "SANDERS: Yeah. Let me pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through  are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally. And yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment, it is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald's workers.\n",
      "We need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of a few countries that does not have universal high-quality affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the  next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, tax breaks for billionaires, and then tell the moms and dads in this country we cannot have high-quality affordable childcare.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, I'm coming to you now.\n",
      "SANDERS: That is wrong.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, infant care is more expensive than in-state public college tuition in more than half the country. Do you support free universal infant care?\n",
      "BIDEN: There should be free universal infant care, but here's the deal. You know, I was a single parent, too. When my wife and daughter were killed, my two boys I had to raise. I was a senator, a young senator. I just hadn't been sworn in yet. And I was making $, a year.\n",
      "I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware, over  miles a day — excuse me,  miles a day, because I could not afford but for my family childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it.\n",
      "And that's why there are several things we do. When I triple the amount of money for Title I schools, every child, , , and  years old, will, in fact, have full schooling. They'll go to school and after-school programs, which will release some of the burden.\n",
      "Secondly, I think we should have an $, tax credit which would put  million women back to work that could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $, tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who, in fact, are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care.\n",
      "But Bernie's right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care. And I provide for that, as well. My time is up, I know, but I'm not going to go over like everybody. [laughter]\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg — Mayor Buttigieg, higher education is another huge expense for families. You oppose free public college for all because you don't want to make it, quote, \"free for the kids of millionaires.\" But lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people, like libraries and public schools. Why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's simple. We expect and hope for everyone to get through th grade. It's not the same for college. Now, again, I don't want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college. And under my plan, it won't be.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, for the first  percent of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges. But if you're in that top income bracket, don't get me wrong, I still wish you well. I hope you succeed when you go to college. I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition, because we could be using those dollars for something else.\n",
      "There is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise, and we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure, and something that hasn't come up very much tonight but deserves a lot of attention, poverty.\n",
      "You know, the Poor People's Campaign is marching on Iowa right now calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith. I think because even though in politics we're supposed to talk middle class, they know there's no scripture that says as you've done unto the middle class, so you've done unto me.\n",
      "We've got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars where they will make the biggest difference. And I don't think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition at public colleges is the best use of those scarce taxpayer dollars.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: So, look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $ million to pay more. And that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $ million in the first year in taxes.\n",
      "If he wants to send his kid to public university, then I'm OK with that, because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place, to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay, because that's how we build an economy and, for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt.\n",
      "You do universal childcare and you've got a lot of mamas who can go to work, a lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. We've got a lot of people who...\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator. Sen. Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yeah, you know, I appreciate your thoughts, Elizabeth, but I want to step back. I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren't actually thinking big enough.\n",
      "I think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy. Where are our job openings? And what do we need? We are going to have over a million openings for home health care workers that we don't know how to fill in the next  years. We are going to have open , jobs for nursing assistants. We— as my union friends know — we're going to have over , openings for electricians.\n",
      "We're not going to have a shortage of MBAs. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers. So when we look at that, then we step back. Where should our money go? It should go into K through . It should go into free one- and two-year degrees, like my dad got, like my sister got.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: And then we should double the Pell grants, because we're going to need four-year degrees...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar. Mr. Steyer...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: ... so the money goes where it should go, instead of to rich kids going to college.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer, as a billionaire, should your children have been entitled to free public college?\n",
      "STEYER: No. And let me say this. I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust, and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need.\n",
      "But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education, because we're talking a lot about college. But, in fact, if you talk about the Poor People's Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that's relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance, so we're not legislating inequality for the next generation, and so we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that.\n",

      "Tomorrow, the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the United States Senate, launching the third trial of a U.S. president. The Republican-led Senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, if you're the nominee, is it going to be harder to run against President Trump if he's been acquitted and able to claim vindication, especially after what he's said about your family?\n",
      "BIDEN: It's irrelevant. There's no — there's no choice but to — for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has, in fact, committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not, it's for them to decide.\n",
      "But — and, by the way, I'm told that, you know, we — that I don't — I say we have to unite the country and it's going to be harder after this trial. It may be. But, look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican Party. They've got gone after — savaged my surviving son, gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won't even carry on television because they're flat-out lies.\n",
      "And I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasn't done his job. And so it doesn't really matter whether or not he's gone after me. I've got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I can't hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal.\n",
      "And as president of the United States, that's what I will attempt to do, notwithstanding that — we're going to be more division after he's defeated by me this next time.\n",
      "BLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, you're going to be a juror in the trial in the Senate that's about to start. Do you worry President Trump will be emboldened by acquittal?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: No. We have a constitutional duty to do — to perform here. And when I look at what the issue is, it's whether or not we're going to be able to have witnesses. We've asked for only four people as witnesses. And if our Republican colleagues won't allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king. And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didn't want to be ruled by a king.\n",
      "And I think the best way to think about this is trial and what we're facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa. His name was Joseph Welch. He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants. He became the Army counsel. And he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings. And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man.\n",
      "Everyone that was afraid, they were afraid of being blacklisted, Joseph Welch, he stood up and looked at McCarthy and said, have you no sense of decency, sir? Have you no sense of decency. This is a decency check on our government. This is a patriotism check. Not only is this trial that...\n",

      "STEYER: Well, Wolf, actually what I have done is to organize a petition drive of . million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those . million people have called their congresspeople, have emailed their congresspeople, and have actually dragged Washington, D.C., to see that in fact this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency.\n",
      "So if you ask me whether standing up for what's right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the Constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn't worth it, then you don't share the idea that I do about what America is about.\n",

That includes the president of the United States. We have an impeachment trial. I will be there because it is my responsibility.\n",
      "But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That is what lies at heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first. Not the American people. Not the interests of the United States of America. Not even helping Ukraine defend against Russia.\n",
      "It is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats we're not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That's why we're here.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Let's turn now to the climate crisis. Here in Iowa parts of the state remain under water after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $ billion in damages. Today many Iowans are still displaced from their homes.\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, you have talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding. But what do you do about farms and factories that simply can't be moved?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: That's why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. Seeing it in Iowa. We have seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once-in-a-millennium flood. Then two years later had to do the same thing.\n",
      "In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical and this is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes, to adapt, to make sure communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other.\n",
      "But we also have to ensure that we don't allow this to get any worse. And if we get right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them, whether we're talking about farmers or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them...\n",

      "PFANNENSTIEL: ... to clarify, what do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency. And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories, and that disproportionately happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward.\n",

      "PFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you're the climate change candidate, but you made your $. billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. So are you the right messenger on this topic?\n",
      "STEYER: I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy. And over  years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the Giving Pledge to give most of my money away while I'm alive. And for  years I have been fighting the climate crisis.\n",
      "I have beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I have stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: So actually, yes, I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says, I'll make it priority one, because I have been doing it for a long time.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "Sen. Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipeline and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review. Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can't overturn?\n",
      "WARREN: Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. And the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands, and offshore drilling. That will help us get in the right directions. I'll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution.\n",
      "We should see this for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the s we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.\n",
      "But you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on health care, on all of the issues that matter to us.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all-out ban on fracking. You haven't. Why not?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, I would note that I have  percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters. And that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems.\n",
      "And one thing that hasn't been raised, by the way, is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones.\n",
      "When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. It's a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral.\n",
      "Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar. And that is to get to carbon neutral by  to , to get to by  to a  percent reduction.\n",
      "And I want to add one thing that no one's really answered. When we do this, we have to make sure that we make people whole. And when we put a tax on carbon, which we will do either through cap-and-trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: ... then we have to make sure the money goes back to the people...\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: I want to...\n",

      "PFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Thank you. [laughter]\n",
      "Let's be clear. If we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by , not by , but unless we lead the world right now — not easy stuff— the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy.\n",
      "We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need.\n",
      "This is of course a national crisis. I introduced legislation to indicate it's a national crisis. We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. That's what the Green New Deal does. That's what my legislation does. And that is what we have to do.\n",
      "PFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: My response is, back in , I introduced the first climate change bill — and check PolitiFacts; they said it was a game-changer. I've been fighting this for a long time. I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to — to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America.\n",
      "Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away. And the way we act right away is, immediately if I'm elected president, I'll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration which were taken down. That's  billion gallons of gasoline — barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately.\n",
      "And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what's already happened, we should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads, makes sure that we're in a position where we have — that every new highway built is a green highway, having , charging stations.\n",
      "We can create — and this is where I agree with Tom — we can create millions of good-paying jobs. We're the only country in the world that's ever taken great crisis and turned it into great opportunity. And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa, by making them the first group in the world to get to net zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right — there's more to say, but I know my time is...\n",
      "PHILLIP: A key part of your mission in this primary is going to be to prove to Democratic voters that you're strong enough to take on Donald Trump. Each of you face unique challenges in doing that.\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, you say you've had trouble earning the support of black voters because you're unknown. But you've been campaigning for a year now and polling shows you with next to no black support, support that you'll need in order to beat Donald Trump. Is it possible that black voters have gotten to know you and have simply decided to choose another candidate?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: The black voters who know me best are supporting me. It's why I have the most support in South Bend. It's why, among elected black officials in my community who have gotten into this race, by far most of them are supporting me.\n",
      "And now, nationally, I am proud that my campaign is co-chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders, from Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County.\n",
      "Now, the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted. And I never will. The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that I'm perfect. It's because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can, not from the luxury of — of a debate or a television panel or a committee room but on the ground, issues from poverty to justice in policing.\n",
      "And I'm proud to say we have been nationally recognized for our work as a race-informed city on delivering greater economic justice, that we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing.\n",
      "Of course there is a much longer way to go, in my community and around the country. But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, you call yourself a Democratic Socialist. But more than two-thirds of voters say they are not enthusiastic about voting for a socialist. Doesn't that put your chances of beating Donald Trump at risk?\n",
      "SANDERS: Nope, not at all. And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is corrupt. He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud.\n",
      "Now, when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Donald Trump as a businessman received $ million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing.\n",
      "My Democratic Socialism says health care is a human right. We're going to raise the minimum wage to  bucks an hour. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We're going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $ million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren. We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company. That is what Democratic Socialism is about and that will win this election.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mr. Steyer, you've spent more than $ million of your own dollars on television ads. How do you convince voters that you're more than just your money?\n",
      "STEYER: Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president. He's going to run on the economy. He's already told Americans last month in Florida, \"You don't like me and I don't like you, but you're all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in  minutes if they get in control.\"\n",
      "So let's be clear. I started a business by myself in one room. I didn't inherit a penny from my parents. I spent  years building that business into a multi-billion-dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power.\n",
      "But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy. And I have the experience and the expertise to show that he's a fake there and a fraud.\n",
      "Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have  years of international business experience. I can beat Trump on the economy. We're going to have to beat him on the economy. And I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: You demoted me. I was actually an associate, but that's OK. [laughter]\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: It was not the biggest part of my career. But I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on, and guided that community through a historic transformation.\n",
      "When, at the beginning of the decade, I took office, we were described as a dying city. I'm ready to take on Donald Trump because, when he gets to the tough talk and the chest-thumping, he'll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve.\n",
      "And if — and if he keeps trying...[applause]...to use religion...[applause]...\n",
      "If a guy like Donald Trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit Christianity into the GOP, I will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that God does not belong to a political party. I am ready to take on this president...\n",
      "PHILLIP: Thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: ... on everything. [applause]\n",
      "PHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar... [applause]\n",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, you're pitching yourself as a practical candidate who can get things done. And even tonight you've dismissed some of the ideas that are offered in this primary as pipe-dreams. How are you going to inspire Democratic voters with a message of pragmatism?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Our voters, actually all Americans, have seen now a number of years of a guy that has, I think, told over , lies. He is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric. And I think what Americans want is something different.\n",
      "I am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in Iowa, \"The Midwest is not flyover country for me; I live here.\"\n",
      "I'm going to be able to look at him and say, \"You've treated these workers and farmers like poker chips. For me, these are my friends and these are my neighbors.\"\n",
      "I'm going to be able to look at him and say, \"You know what? You got $ million over the course of your career. That's how you built your fortune.\" And what I'm going to say is this. \"My grandpa worked , feet underground in the iron ore mines, saved money in a coffee can in the basement, to send my dad to a two-year community college. That's my family trust. And when you have been given an opportunity like that, you go into the world not with a sense of entitlement, Donald — Donald Trump, but with a sense of obligation.\"\n",
      "PHILLIP: Thank you.\n",
      "Sen. Warren, what do you say to voters who like your policies but they're worried they will scare away swing voters you need to win this race in November?\n",
      "WARREN: So I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers who are all retired, who are all back there still. And two of my three brothers are Republicans. And, sure, there are a lot of things we disagree on, and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic/Republican talking points, but the truth is there's a whole lot we agree on.\n",
      "You know, my brother is just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon, that are giant corporations making billions of dollars in tax — make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes.\n",
      "My brother said, \"I don't get this. I have to pay my taxes. Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense.\"\n",
      "They understand that we have an America right now that's working great for those at the top; it's just not working for anyone else. We have a chance to unite — unite as Democrats, but also with independents and Republicans who are sick of living in a country that's working great for the politicians that are taking the money; it's working great for the lobbyists; it's working great for the corporate executives, it's just not working for everyone else.\n",
      "I'm building the grassroots movement, leading the fight. We're going to make this America work for everyone else. That is how we're going to beat Donald Trump.\n",
      "PHILLIP: Vice President Biden, the eventual nominee will face President Trump, who has no problem mocking people, using insulting nicknames, slinging mud and telling lies. The debate against him will make tonight's debate look like child's play.\n",
      "Are you prepared for that?\n",
      "BIDEN: I am prepared for that. Look, I've been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage. [laughter]\n",
      "I've taken all the hits he can deliver, and I'm getting better in the polls, my going up. And by the way, I have overwhelming support from the African-American community, overwhelming — more than everybody else in this operation, number one.\n",
      "Number two, working-class people, where I come from, in Pennsylvania and the places I come from Delaware, I have great support.\n",
      "I have support across the board, and I'm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all. And with regard to the economy, I can hardly wait to have that debate with him. Where I come from, the neighbors I come from, they're in real trouble, working-class people and middle-class people.\n",
      "When the middle class does well, the working class has a way up and the wealthy do well. But what's happening now? They're being clobbered. They're being killed. They now have a situation where if they — the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that they've — they've reached in economic security.\n",
      "We — I love that debate because the American public is getting clobbered. The wealthy are the only ones doing well, period. I'm looking forward to the economic debate.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Donald Trump thinks this is all about him. I think it's about you. It's not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego. It is about your health care. It is about your schools. It is about your lives and your future.\n",
      "So if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety, we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her. I have won every race, every place, every time. I have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when I've led the ticket. I have passed more bills as the lead Democrat than anyone who's in Congress that's running for president. I believe that we need a president that's going to look out for you.\n",
      "It is easy to hurl insults. It is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day. What is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth. What is hard is the work of governing.\n",

The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love. And as far as I'm concerned, the American people are my teammates.\n",
      "And if there's one thing I will not permit, it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face. And that is exactly what I've seen over the last seven years, traveling around this country, seeing these Republicans, led by Mr. Trump, basically kicking the American people in the face.\n",
      "I am prepared to take on Mr. Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy. But I am asking for your support because I know that if I'm — if I'm going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything, without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world.\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: This is our moment, this is our one shot to defeat Donald Trump, and to do it by such a big margin that we send Trumpism into the dust bin of history, too. But we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same Washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point.\n",
      "If you are watching this at home and you are exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction, I'm asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics. You're seeing the president boast about the Dow Jones, wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table. Join me.\n",

      "BLITZER: Sen. Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: So much is broken in this country. I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didn't get to talk about tonight: how the disability community is struggling for true equality; how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country; how children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink; how transwomen, particularly transwomen of color, are at risk; black infant mortality; climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities; people who are being crushed by student loan debt; farmers who are barely holding on; people struggling with mental illness.\n",

      "How does it happen that when the top  percent owns more wealth than the bottom  percent, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight?

      "WOODRUFF: Welcome back.\n",
      "A quick reminder to have rules for this debate. Each candidate has one minute and  seconds to answer direct questions from the moderators, and  seconds to answer rebuttal and follow-up questions.\n",
      "Tonight's podium order on the stage was determined by an average of recent polls.\n",
      "And let's begin.\n",
      "To the candidates -- last night, at this hour, the House of Representatives voted for only the third time in American history to impeach a president. Every one of you was in favor of this action. But unlike  and President Nixon, congressional Democrats have, so far, not convinced a strong majority of Americans to support impeachment of President Trump.\n",
      "Why do you think that is, and what can you say or do differently in the coming weeks to persuade more Americans that this is the right thing to do?\n",
      "I want to ask all of you to respond, but to begin with Vice President Biden.\n",
      "BIDEN: You know, Judy, it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did. And, you know, Trump's response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now, I find, is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do. You know, is it any wonder that if you look at the international polling that's been done, that the Chinese leader is rated above American -- the American president or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, stand fast and, in fact, it was a mistake to impeach him.\n",
      "You know, we need to restore the integrity of the presidency, the office of the presidency, and it's about time we get that underway. My job and I think the job of all of us up here is to, in fact -- well, that's not true, some are going to actually be voting in the Senate -- but my job is just to go out and make the case why he doesn't deserve to be president of the United States for another four years.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, why do you think more people are not in support of impeachment and what else can you do?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country, and we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign, he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else.\n",
      "I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president ho has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president.\n",
      "And the case is to be made is -- yes, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand is that we cannot have a president with that temperament who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Warren, why do you think -- [applause] -- why do you think more Americans don't agree that this is the right thing to do? And what more can you say?\n",
      "WARREN: So, I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate who has taken a constitutional oath to uphold our Constitution -- and that doesn't mean loyalty to an individual, it doesn't mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country -- and that vote will play out over the next several weeks.\n",
      "But the way I see this is we've now seen the impact of corruption, and that's what's clearly on the stage in , is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history.\n",
      "You know, this president has made corruption originally his argument that he would drain the swamp, and, yet, he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships.\n",
      "We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight not for the wealthy and well-connected but to fight for everyone else. That's why I'm in this race. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, what argument can you make to persuade more Americans this is the right thing?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, the president is not king in America, the law is king. And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the Constitutional Convention -- and, by the way, I think he's a pretty good size for a president, he was five-foot-four. [laughter]\n",
      "And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the Constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here.\n",
      "Watergate -- this is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent.\n",

Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that, actually, the most corrupt president in American history -- it's not a question of political expediency, it's not a question of political tactics, it's a question of right and wrong.\n",
      "So, now, when we look at what's going on, I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar. The question here is, if we want the American people to understand what's going on, we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge.\n",

Congressional approval rating, last I checked, was something like  percent, and Americans don't trust the media networks to tell them the truth.\n",
      "The media networks didn't do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place.

      "Senator Sanders, today, the House of Representatives voted for a new bipartisan trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. It was supported by union-friendly leaders like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and big labor groups like the AFL-CIO. They say it is going to be a big job creator.\n",
      "Senator, my question is, will you support this deal? And, if not, why not?\n",
      "SANDERS: Judy, you're talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNTR with China -- two agreements that cost us over  million decent-paying jobs.\n",
      "Now, I don't agree with the -- your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions, independent unions and be able to negotiate decent contracts.\n",
      "But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than $ an hour.\n",
      "What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers. And, by the way, the word \"climate change,\" to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So, no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I have a different view. I'll go with my friend, Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that's come in front of him, and he's voting for this, and I am, too.\n",
      "And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we've got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also opposed.\n",
      "Ninety-five percent of our customers are outside of our borders. And we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says \"Made in America,\" it is the ingenuity of our workers, it is the quality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people.\n",
      "I think this agreement -- while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it -- is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: All right, we can pull some of your -- I see some other hands up. I want to move to the next question, and you can bring in, I think, your points with this.\n",
      "This one I'm going to initially address to Vice President Biden, and that is the overall U.S. economy right now looks strong. The unemployment rate is at historic lows. Unemployment among African-Americans is down. The markets are booming. Wages, while not growing as much as many would like, they're still doing about as well as they were in the Obama-Biden era.\n",
      "My question to you, Mr. Vice President, is what is your argument to the voter watching this debate tonight who may not like everything President Trump does but they really like this economy and they don't know why they should make a change.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, I don't think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighborhoods and middle-class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed. And the working class has no way up as a consequence of that.\n",
      "You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest,  percent of them couldn't pay their bills last year. You have most Americans, if they received a bill for $ or more, they'd have to sell something or borrow the money.\n",
      "The middle class is not as behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate a significant number of these god-awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in health care. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle-class people so they can maintain their standard of living.\n",
      "That's not being done. And the idea that we're growing -- we're not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are. And that's why we must change this presidency now. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Mayor Buttigieg, is that your -- is that your assessment?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes. Where I live, folks aren't measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking. They're measuring the economy by how they're doing. When you're doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table, and you find that even if your wages have gone up, it's not nearly going as fast as the cost of health and housing.\n",
      "This economy is not working for most of us, for the middle class, and -- I know you're only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we've got to talk about poverty in this country. There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full-time at the minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment. In most places, not even a one-bedroom apartment.\n",
      "The biggest problem in our economy is simple: People are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. It's the result of bad policy. And we've got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers. [applause]\n",

      "The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with people's lived experience on the ground. If you're a recent college graduate, you have a  percent chance of doing a job that doesn't require a college degree.

      "WARREN: Because here's the problem. I'm proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rise in GDP, rise in corporate profits is not being felt by millions of families across this country. I'm proud to stand on a stage with people who see that America's middle class is being hollowed out and that working families and poor people are being left behind.\n",
      "What we need to talk about, though, is why that has happened. And the answer is we've got a government that works great for those with money and doesn't work for much of anyone else. We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money on private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart.\n",
      "Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. [applause]\n",

      "SANDERS: Look, here's the response. Trump goes around saying the economy is doing great. Do you know what real inflation accounted for wages went up last year? . percent. That ain't great.\n",
      "Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, , Americans, including , veterans, are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality than since the s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the  percent. That is what our campaign is about. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Warren, I have a question for you. Every candidate on the stage has proposed tax increases on the wealthy. But you have especially ambitious plans that, apart from health care, would hike taxes an additional $ trillion over the decade, the biggest tax increase since World War II. How do you answer top economists who say taxes of this magnitude would stifle growth and investment?\n",
      "WARREN: Oh, they're just wrong. [applause]\n",
      "Let's start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two-cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, $ million and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age  to , universal pre-K for every -year-old and -year-old, and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher.\n",
      "We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates. We can cancel student loan debt. But think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires, they're not eating more pizzas, they're not buying more cars. We invest that  percent in early childhood education and childcare, that means those babies get top-notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas and their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: And...\n",
      "WARREN: We can increase productivity in this country. And we can start building this economy from the ground up. That's how we build it in small towns. That's how we build it in rural America. And that's how we built it in urban America. An economy that works, not for Wall Street, but that works for Main Street.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Brief answers -- brief responses from Mr. Steyer and Mr. Buttigieg. [applause]\n",
      "STEYER: So let me say that I agree with Senator Warren in much of what she says. I've been for a wealth tax for over a year. I'm in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations that this administration has put through. [applause]\n",
      "And in addition, I've talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for  percent of Americans by  percent.\n",
      "But there's something else going on here that I think is really important, and that's this. We know Mr. Trump is going to run on the economy. I built a business over  years from scratch. We're going to have to take him on, on the economy in terms of growth, as well as economic justice. We're going to have to be able to talk about growth, prosperity across the board for everyone in America.\n",
      "My experience building a business, understanding how to make that happen, means I can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure. And I think that's different from the other people on this stage. I think we need a different, unconventional way of attacking a different, unconventional president who actually went after the best-prepared candidate in American history and beat her.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We're also being -- right now, I think we're being offered a false choice that you either have to go all the way to the extreme or it's business as usual. Yes, we must deliver big ideas and, yes, taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up.\n",
      "We can also be smart about the promises we're making, make sure they're promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy.\n",
      "It's why, for example, I've proposed that we make college free for  percent of Americans. But it doesn't have to be free for the top. If you're in that top  percent, how about you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on that would make a big difference, whether it's infrastructure, childcare, housing, health?\n",
      "On issue after issue, we've got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize.\n",

      "ALBERTA: Thanks, Judy. Candidates, good evening. We're going to talk about climate now. Senator Klobuchar, many scientists say that even if the U.S. reduced its carbon footprint to zero by the year , the damage will have been done, that climate change will have made certain places in the U.S. unlivable.\n",
      "So knowing this, would you support a new federal program to subsidize the relocation of American families and businesses away from places like Miami or Paradise, California, perhaps, Davenport, Iowa, because we know these places are going to be hit time and time again?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, I don't -- I very much hope we're not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents.\n",
      "And the problem right now is that this climate change is an existential crisis. And you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California, as was mentioned with Paradise. And the most moving video from that to me was the -second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down.\n",
      "We cannot wait to act. There is an Ojibway saying that great leaders make decisions not for this generation, but seven generations from now. This president doesn't keep his decisions for seven minutes. [applause]\n",
      "So what I think we need to do, get back into the international climate change agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules. On day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California, who's been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduce sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards.\n",
      "ALBERTA: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n",
      "Mr. Steyer, would you support such a new federal program, again, to help subsidize the relocation of these families?\n",
      "STEYER: Look, I am hoping that we, in fact, will do what I'm suggesting, which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency. I have made this -- I believe I'm the only person here who will say unequivocally this is my number-one priority.\n",
      "I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. I've been working on this for more than a decade. I've taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws. I've pushed clean energy across this country. I've prevented pipelines and I've prevented fossil fuel plants.\n",
      "But what I know is this: Not only can we clear up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated, this is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle-class union jobs, well-paid, across the United States of America.\n",
      "Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity. And if we don't declare a state of emergency on day one, I don't understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead.\n",
      "Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage. I know everybody is worried about this. But, for instance, I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now, but it's also...\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, I've made clear that this will be a topic of day one action. And this is not theoretical for me. I live in one of those river cities that you're talking about. Not only that, I live right by the river. My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years. Do the math on that. So I know what's at stake.\n",
      "And it's why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research, on renewable energy, energy storage, and carbon storage. But bigger than that, we have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this.\n",
      "I've seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change as long as I've been alive, all these plans we have to get carbon neutral by . And I think most or all of us have one. Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done.\n",
      "ALBERTA: We'd like to switch...\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the autoworker down the block from me in South Bend to a farmer a few minutes away so that they understand that we are asking, recruiting them to be part of the solution, not beating them over the head and telling them they're part of the problem.\n",
      "ALBERTA: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We'd like to switch gears slightly.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, I'd like to ask you. Three consecutive American presidents have enjoyed stints of explosive economic growth due to a boom in oil and natural gas production. As president, would you be willing to sacrifice some of that growth, even knowing potentially that it could displace thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers in the interest of transitioning to that greener economy?\n",
      "BIDEN: The answer is yes. The answer is yes, because the opportunity -- the opportunity for those workers to transition to high-paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. We're the only country in the world that's ever taken great, great crises and turned them into enormous opportunities.\n",
      "I've met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, be making that -- making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesn't leak energy, that, in fact -- we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make their homes turn to solar power, where -- there's all kinds of folks out here, right here in California, who are now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when, in fact, the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining.\n",
      "We have enormous opportunities. For example, you talk about, would we relocate people who, in fact, were in a position where they lost their home? We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people. We have to rebuild with the standard that exists today.\n",
      "For example, we shouldn't build another new highway in America that doesn't have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put , charging stations so that we own the electrical vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people installing them, as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. There are so many things we can do, and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced, that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities.\n",
      "ALBERTA: Thank you, Vice President Biden. [applause]\n",
      "Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. [applause]\n",
      "The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You're talking about the Paris agreement, that's fine. Ain't enough. We have got to -- and I've introduced legislation to do this -- declare a national emergency.\n",
      "The United States has got to lead the world. And maybe, just maybe, instead of spending $. trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders, can lead the world, instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.\n",
      "ALBERTA: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Thank you, Senator Sanders. [applause]\n",
      "Senator Warren, a new question to you, Senator Warren. Many of our Western allies rely heavily on nuclear energy because it's efficient, affordable, and virtually carbon-free. And many climate experts believe that it's impossible to realize your goal of net zero emissions by the year  without utilizing nuclear energy. So can you have it both ways on this issue?\n",
      "WARREN: So I see right now is we've got to get the carbon -- we've got to stop putting more carbon into the air. We've got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water. And that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place.\n",
      "I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy, literally, and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by tenfold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best, and that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader.\n",
      "But understand, the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keep saying the right thing but continue to take money from the oil industry, continue to bow down to the lobbyists, to the lawyers, to the think-tanks, to the bought-and-paid-for experts.\n",
      "America understands that we've got to make change and we're running out of time, that climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. But getting Congress to act, you know, they just don't want to hear it. And if we don't attack the corruption first, if we don't attack the corruption head-on, then we're not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate, on gun safety, on drug pricing, on all of the big problems that face us.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Yeah, I want to add to what Elizabeth said. So the way we tackle corruption is by winning big in this election. And the way we take on climate change in a big way is by, yes, talking about what's happening on the coasts, as I just did, but also talking about what's happening in the Midwest, where I'm from. It's not flyover country to me. I live there.\n",
      "And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We're seeing an increase,  percent increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years. And when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon, that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change, and to make them whole with their energy bills.\n",
      "When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes. You win big. And I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who is from the Midwest. [applause]\n",

      "BIDEN: Look, I didn't say return to normal. Normal's not enough. Normal -- in fact, we have to move beyond normal, whether it's health care, the environment, whatever it is. We have to build on what we had started in our administration, and that's been interrupted very badly, number one.\n",

If you're a black woman, you're  percent more likely to die from complications in childbirth.\n",

      "WOODRUFF: I want to turn to another part of the world, and that's China. Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that you think China presents more of a challenge than do your fellow candidates believe. The U.S. clearly wants China's cooperation on human rights, on climate change, on North Korea, on terrorism. And yet Americans are appalled by China's record on human rights, including the detention of over a million Muslim Uighurs. Should the U.S., is my question, do more than protest and issue sanctions? Should the U.S., for example, boycott the  Beijing Olympics?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I think that any tool ought to be on the table, especially diplomatic, economic, and social tools, like what you're describing.\n",
      "Look, for the president to let it be known that his silence, whether it's on the rounding up of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, putting them into camps, or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy, for him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values.\n",
      "The reality is that there's a lot more to the relationship with China than who's selling more dishwashers. Yes, we need a much smarter trade policy. We also have to acknowledge what's going on over there: the use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship.\n",
      "That is going to require a stronger than ever response from the U.S. in defense of democracy. But when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the president of the United States, what message is that sending to the Chinese Communist Party?\n",

      "STEYER: Look, there is a temptation, particularly for this president, to try and answer that on a bilateral -- in a bilateral way. The way the United States should be reacting in Hong Kong is by gathering our coalition of democracy- and freedom-loving partners and allies to push back.\n",
      "In fact, when we're making moral statements around the world, it should not be us threatening and trying to be the world's policeman. It should be us leading on a value-driven basis with the other people who share our values and want to change the world.\n",
      "We actually can't isolate ourselves from China. In fact, we have to work with them as a frenemy. People who disturb us, who we disagree with, but who, in effect, we are linked to in a world that is ever getting closer. And, in fact, if we are going to treat climate as the threat that it is, we are going to have to partner with the Chinese. They are going to have to come along with us. They're going to have to trust us. And together we're going to have to solve this problem.\n",

A million Uighurs, as you pointed out, Muslims, are in concentration camps. That's where they are right now. They're being abused. They're in concentration camps.\n",
      "And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped, we should be moving  percent of our sea power to that area of the world to let, in fact, the Chinese understand that they're not going to go any further. We are going to be there to protect other folks.\n",
      "Secondly, we, in fact, should make sure that we begin to rebuild our alliances, which Trump has demolished, with Japan and South Korea, Australia and all -- and Indonesia. We, in fact, need to have allies who understand that we're going to stop the Chinese from their actions.\n",
      "We should be going to the U.N. immediately and sought sanctions against them in the United Nations for what they did. We have to be firm. We don't have to go to war. But we have to make it clear, this is as far as you go, China.\n",
      "And in terms of their military build-up, it's real. But it would take them about  years to build up to where we are. We're not looking for a war. But we've got to make clear, we are a Pacific power and we are not going to back away.\n",

      "Here is the issue. The issue is where power resides in America, and it's not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians.\n",
      "You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the s. We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all.\n",
      "We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and economy that works for all, not just the  percent.\n",

      "ALBERTA: OK.\n",
      "BIDEN: Number one. Look, I'm running -- I'm running because I've been around, on my experience. With experience hopefully comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom. The fact is that we're in a position now, the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things, an economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be -- where we have to unite America. And a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able to on day one stand up, look out, the entire world know who that person is, know what they stand for, and know they know them.\n",

If you look at the poll -- the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory, it showed that I'd beat Donald Trump by  points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage.\n",

      "NAWAZ: Thanks, Tim. I want to turn now to an issue that's been in the headlines quite a bit, and that is immigration. Mr. Yang, we have a question here from a professor right here at Loyola, Marymount. There are nearly , DACA recipients, so-called Dreamers, in the state of California, more than any other state, including several students right here at LMU. If you win and you reinstate DACA through executive action, another president could just overturn it again. So will you move on a permanent legislative fix for Dreamers in your first  days, if elected?\n",
      "YANG: Of course I would. I'm the son of immigrants myself, and I know that Dreamers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification. [applause]\n",
      "I just want to return to this conversation, because I think it's core. Our country is deeply misogynist, and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. That's where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation.\n",
      "The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons. [applause]\n",
      "I'm on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government, because the fact is, if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons. [laughter and applause]\n",
      "So it's related to our campaign finance rules, because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace. And that includes the marketplace for politicians. If we were to put  democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of  percent contributing, you'd see that rate skyrocket to  percent or  percent, and you'd have many, many more women who would run for office because they don't have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.

      "KLOBUCHAR: Could I address immigration reform?\n",
      "NAWAZ: You pledged to move -- you pledged to move on a permanent legislative fix in your first  days. Dreamers say that they are frustrated by Democrats' failure to prioritize their status in deal after deal. So why should Dreamers trust Democrats now?\n",
      "YANG: I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by Dreamers in the first  days. I would make it a top priority. I'm the son of immigrants myself. The fact is, almost half of Fortune  companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants. Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic. [applause]\n",
      "And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, it's not wall-to-wall immigrants. It's wall-to-wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration.\n",
      "And as your president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if you are considering immigrating to this country and I am the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States. That's the opposite of the current administration, and that's the message I would love to send to the world.\n",

      "SANDERS: I can't respond to the immigration question?\n",
      "NAWAZ: This is related, sir. But there are estimated to be as many as  million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., more than  million right here in California. If you have a chance to forge a bipartisan immigration reform plan, would you insist on a path to citizenship for all  million or just a segment of that population?\n",
      "SANDERS: This is what I would do. Day one, executive order, restore the legal status of . million young people in the DACA program. [applause]\n",
      "Day one, we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers. [applause]\n",

      "Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win re-election by dividing us up. We are going to win this election by bringing our people together -- black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American. That's what this campaign is about.

      "NAWAZ: Senator Klobuchar, you had your hand up.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. I started my day-to-day with a group of immigrants who were there talking to me about housing. And I thought about this president and what he's done. He has used our immigrants as political pawns. Every single day, he tries to draw a wedge. I will be a different president.\n",
      "My view on this comes from experience. When I got to the Senate, Senator Kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package. We got so close to passing that. I voted for it. Not everyone did. But most of the Democrats did.\n",
      "Then I was on the Judiciary Committee when President Obama was president. And we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes.\n",
      "Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the Dreamers that would have solved that problem. We didn't get that done because this president gut-punched us.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I will take my views. I will take this experience. I will get this done because immigrants don't diminish America. They are America.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, briefly, your response?\n",
      "STEYER: Listen, I think it's important to note that this president is not against immigration. He's against immigration by nonwhite people.\n",
      "WARREN: Yes. [applause]\n",
      "STEYER: This is his attempt to divide us, as Senator Sanders said, on race. And that's what he's been doing since the very first day he started running for president. He's been vilifying non-white people. He's been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if, in fact, white people lose control of this country, that they're going to lose control of their lives.\n",
      "And as somebody who lives in a majority-minority state, which is California, what he's doing is so wrong on so many different levels.\n",
      "I agree with Senator Sanders. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right. This is a racial argument by a racist president who's trying to divide us and who's vilifying people. It's absolutely wrong. And it's led him to break the laws of humanity in our name.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. [applause]\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, a new question to you, Mr. Mayor. You said last month that the U.S. owes compensation to children separated from their families at the southern border. The consensus among child welfare experts is that those thousands of children will likely suffer lifelong trauma as a result of that separation. Are you committing as president to financial compensation for those thousands of children?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, and they should have a fast track to citizenship, because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong. We have a moral obligation to make right what was broken.\n",
      "And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isn't theoretical. It's not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family, came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. citizen.\n",
      "It comes from the fact that I'm the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants. And I've seen those same neighborhoods shut down, families huddling in church, panicking just because of the rumor of an ICE raid. That did not make our country safer.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Could I respond?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I had to look into the eyes of an -year-old boy whose father was deported, even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name, and try to think of something to tell that boy because I couldn't tell him what he most wanted to hear, which is just that he was going to have his dad back. How could harming that young man possibly make America safer?\n",
      "NAWAZ: Mr. Mayor, just...\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: When I am president, based on those experiences, I will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values. And that means not only ending these unspeakable, cruel practices at the border, but finally and truly fixing the immigration system that has needed a full overhaul since the s.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Mr. Mayor...\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We cannot wait  years,  years. We cannot wait anymore to do something about this.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just to follow up...[applause]...since you do support compensation for those families, should the U.S. also compensate descendants of enslaved people? Do you support reparations for African-Americans?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I support H.R. , which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations. But we shouldn't wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative.\n",
      "Remember, we're not talking about a gift to anybody. We're talking about mending what was broken. We're talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African-Americans. And just crossing out a racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver equality.\n",
      "Harms compound, just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time. So does the value of a dollars stolen. And that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority-owned businesses, with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs, and on the longer term look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Vice President Biden, do you support reparations? [applause]\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, let me -- since I haven't spoken on this, I've got a chance. Number one, the reason we're the country we are is because of immigration. We've been able to cherry pick the best from every single continent.\n",
      "The people who come here have determination, resilience. They are ready to stand up and work like the devil. We have  out of every  children in our schools today is Hispanic. The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral, but it's bad for America.\n",
      "They are the future of America and we should invest in them. Everybody will benefit from it, every single American. And you should get used to it. This is a nation of immigrants. That's who we are. That's why we're who we are. That's what makes us different. And we should invest in them. [applause]\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Mr. Biden. Senator Klobuchar, you had your hand up.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, I was -- I was harkening back. I made my case on immigration to what the mayor said about Washington.\n",
      "So I look at this a different way. When we were in the last debate, Mayor, you basically mocked the hundred years of experience on the stage. And what do I see on this stage? I see Elizabeth's work starting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helping  million people. [applause]\n",
      "I see the vice president's work in getting $ billion for his cancer moon shot. I see Senator Sanders' work -- working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle. And I see what I've done, which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills.\n",
      "So while you can dismiss committee hearings, I think this experience works. And I have not denigrated your experience as a local official. I have been one.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: You know -- I'm sorry.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I just think you should respect our experience when you look at how you evaluate someone who can get things done.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Mr. Mayor, I'll give you a chance to respond. [applause]\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: You actually did denigrate my experience, Senator, and it was before the break, and I was going to let it go, because we got bigger fish to fry here. But you implied that my...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Oh, I don't think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the United States.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: You're right. And before the break, you seemed to imply that my relationship to the First Amendment was a talking point, as if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the Constitution than anybody else up here.\n",
      "Let me tell you about my relationship to the First Amendment. It is part of the Constitution that I raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life. That is my experience. And it may not be the same as yours, but it counts, Senator. It counts.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar, you have  seconds to respond.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I have been -- I certainly respect your military experience. That's not what this is about. This is about choosing a president.\n",
      "And I know my view of this is I know you ran to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. That's not something that I wanted to do. I want to be president of the United States. And the point is, we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate Republicans and independents, as well as a fired-up Democratic base, and not just done it once, I have done it three times.\n",
      "I think winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters. And I also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us, have a wider tent, have a bigger coalition, and, yes, longer coattails, that matters.\n",

      "SANDERS: Excuse me.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I got to respond to that. I got to respond to that. Senator, I know that, if you just go by vote totals, maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you. If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with  percent of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana. [applause]\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Again, I would -- Mayor, if you -- if you had won in Indiana, that would be one thing. You tried and you lost by  points. I'm sorry. That's just the math.\n",

Let's talk about how we win an election, which is something everybody here wants to do, in terms of defeating the most dangerous president in American history. So let me tell you how you win it: You have the largest voter turnout in the history of America. [applause]\n",
      "And you don't have -- you don't have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you don't create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America.\n",

      "I'd like to turn to a new subject, and that is, of course, education. Senator Warren, you've proposed free public college tuition and student loan forgiveness for most families. Why should wealthy families be able to send their kids to public college for free? Why not concentrate that government help on those most in need?\n",
      "WARREN: So, as I've talked about before, I have a two cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires, and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies, age  to , to put an historic $ billion investment in public schools K through , and that will permit us to offer technical school, two-year college, four-year college for every single person who wants an education, cancel student loan debt for  -- put a $ billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities, and cancel student loan debt for  million Americans.\n",
      "Look, this is about money, but this is also about values. We need to make an investment in our future, and the best way to do that is let's invest in the public education of our children. That starts when you're babies and it goes long after high school.\n",
      "We want to have families. I meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt. That's why I have a proposal popular among Democrats, popular among Republicans, popular among independents, to ask those at the top to pay a little more so somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves, start a small business, buy a car, create a future for themselves and for this country.\n",
      "ALCINDOR: Thank you, Senator. I see some hands, but I want to go to Mayor Buttigieg.\n",

      "ALCINDOR: Mayor Buttigieg, your plan offers free or discounted public college only to families making up to $, a year. Do you think Senator Warren's plan offers free college to too many families?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I do think that if you're in that lucky top  percent -- I still wish you well, don't get me wrong. I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition.\n",
      "Now, we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that. But if you're in that top  percent, I think you're going to be for the most part OK.\n",
      "And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes. So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires. I just don't agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition.\n",
      "ALCINDOR: Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n",
      "WARREN: So -- no, wait, wait, wait.\n",
      "ALCINDOR: I want to...\n",

      "ALCINDOR: I'm going to let -- I'm going to let you respond, Senator Warren. Go ahead.\n",
      "WARREN: He mentioned me by name. Look, the mayor wants billionaires to pay one tuition for their own kids. I want a billionaire to pay enough to cover tuition for all of our kids, because that's how we build a future.\n",
      "The other part is we've got to deal with student loan debt. And right now, most of the people on this stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionally affects people of color. African-Americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school, more likely to borrow more money while they're in school, and have a harder time paying it off.\n",
      "We want to make an investment in the future? Then open up education for all of our kids. That's how we build a future.\n",
      "ALCINDOR: Thank you, Senator. Senator Sanders?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Could I respond after Bernie?\n",
      "SANDERS: We believe -- I believe in the concept of universality. And one of the crises in America today is people are sick and tired of filling out forms. So you're not eligible for the program today because you're at $,, but you lost your job, are you eligible? You get a better job, you're eligible.\n",
      "I think what we have to do is what we do with Social Security, what we do with public education. Donald Trump's kids can go to a public school. They should be able to go to a public school.\n",
      "What we need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to end this dysfunctional childcare system and make sure that every working-class person in this country can find high-quality, affordable childcare. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And by taxing billionaires and by taxing Wall Street, we will cancel all student debt in this country.\n",

      "ALBERTA: Switching gears here, Mr. Steyer, earlier this year in Iowa, I met a father, Bill Stumpf, and his son, Kyle, in Dubuque. Kyle is a remarkable young adult with significant disabilities. And though he's been employed for about five years at a local pizza parlor, the future is very uncertain for his family.\n",
      "Bill worries that there aren't enough jobs, living facilities, social programs designed to meet the needs of his son. So I'm wonderful, as president, are there specific steps that you would take to help people like Kyle become more integrated into the workforce and into their local communities?\n",
      "STEYER: Look, the United States has made a commitment to treat everybody equally. And that means supporting people with disabilities, both in terms of education and later when they're part of the workforce. That means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that we're treating them fairly, in school and after school, to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible.\n",
      "The question we've got here across the board is, can we afford to do the kinds of things that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are pushing? And the answer is yes, that, in fact, what we need to do is to undo the tax breaks that have been given for two generations to rich Americans and big corporations.\n",
      "Last year, the top  corporations paid an  percent tax. That is absolutely ludicrous.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Could I answer the question?\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "STEYER: So the answer on disabilities is a question of focus and money, as so many of these questions are. We have a country where the government is broken because corporations have bought it, they're getting their way, and for us to get back to government of, by, and for the people that serves Americans, including Americans with disabilities, we're going to have to take that back.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "ALBERTA: Mr. Yang, I didn't hear a specific answer from Mr. Steyer. Can you outline specific steps that the government should take to help integrate these young people into the workforce and into their local communities?\n",
      "YANG: I would love it. I have a son with special needs. And to me, special needs is the new normal in this country. How many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism? [applause]\n",
      "As you look around, most hands went up. The fact is right now, we have to do more for Kyle. Special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases. And here's the challenge. We go to employers and say, hey, this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace, which may be correct, but that's not the point.\n",
      "We have to stop confusing economic value and human value. We have to be able to say to our kids and Kyle that you have intrinsic value because you're an American and you're a human being.\n",
      "We're going to put a freedom dividend of $, a month in everyone's hands, which is going to help families around the country adapt. And then we're going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority, not a local one, so we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n",

      "WOODRUFF: I know we have a lot of hands up. We have so many important topics to discuss.\n",
      "I want to come to you, Senator Klobuchar, on a question of the judges. President Trump has appointed, as we know, two Supreme Court justices. But he's also had confirmed nearly  federal judges, most of whom are young and can shape American law for decades to come.\n",
      "Some of them you voted for in the Senate, including one who just yesterday joined a ruling to strike down a key part of the Affordable Care Act. Would President Trump's appointees -- my question is -- make it harder for you as president, for any of you on this stage to enact your agenda?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Of course. And I want to make it clear that I have opposed many, many judges. And I think everyone will remember what happened at the Kavanaugh hearing when that nominee went after me. I stood my ground and he had to apologize. [applause]\n",
      "So I have been very strong on these judges. As for the judge you just referred to, there was actually -- the judge that wrote the opinion was a judge that went through the Senate unanimously, with support by Senator Sanders, with support by President Obama, with support by then-Senator Kennedy.\n",
      "So I think it is very important, when we look at these judges, to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be OK and they aren't.\n",
      "But what would I do as president? I would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like Elena Kagan and Justice Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, and let's not forget the notorious RBG. That's what I would do. [applause]\n",
      "And if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the Judiciary Committee, look at the judges that I recommended to President Obama, people like Mimi Wright, who is a superstar, and Susan Richard Nelson. Look who I've put in as the first openly gay marshal in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs.\n",
      "And you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that know-how, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learned from when President Obama was in, and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: A follow-up to Mayor Buttigieg. Beyond a pledge not to overturn Roe v. Wade, which I believe all of you have said would be part of your decision-making in choosing a nominee to the court, are there other litmus tests that you would apply in choosing federal judges?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: The Supreme Court is very personal for me, because my household, my marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on that body. And, yes, it is critical that we have justices who understand that American freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom.\n",
      "But that's not all. I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights. I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all. And I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield, which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview, but also begin moving to reform the body itself, as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history, so that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up.

Each of you has said you would push for the passage of the Equality Act, a comprehensive LGBTQ civil rights bill. But if elected, what more would you do to stop violence against transgender people?\n",
      "SANDERS: We need moral leadership in the White House. We need a president who will do everything humanly possible to end all forms of discrimination against the transgender community, against the African-American community, against the Latino community, and against all minorities in this country.\n",

I will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness. I will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification.

      "NAWAZ: Vice President Biden, let's turn now to Afghanistan. Confidential documents published last week by the Washington Post revealed that for years senior U.S. officials misled the public about the war in Afghanistan. As vice president...\n",
      "BIDEN: Afghanistan, you said?\n",
      "NAWAZ: Yes, sir, Afghanistan. As vice president, what did you know about the state of the war? And do you believe that you were honest with the American people about it?\n",
      "BIDEN: The reason I can speak to this -- it's well-known, if any of you followed it, my view on Afghanistan -- I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report. I said there was no comprehensive policy available. And then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation-building notion we set about.\n",
      "Rebuilding that country as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an antiterrorism policy with a very small footprint that, in fact, only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America.\n",
      "The first thing I would do as president of the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home, entered into a negotiation with the Taliban. But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism.\n",
      "That's been my position from the beginning. That's why I think Secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon weren't happy with me.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Mr. Biden, the question was about your time in the White House, though.\n",
      "BIDEN: I'm talking about the White House.\n",
      "NAWAZ: In that Washington Post report, there's a senior national security official who said that there was constant pressure from the Obama White House to produce figures showing the troop surge was working, and I'm quoting from the report here, \"despite hard evidence to the contrary.\" What do you say to that?\n",
      "BIDEN: Since , go back and look. I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon. The only reason I can speak to it now is because it's been published. It's been published thoroughly. I'm the guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it. And I argued against it constantly.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Senator Sanders, you had your hand up. [applause]\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, in all due respect to my -- Joe, Joe, you're also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq. What we need to do is, I think, rethink -- and the Washington Post piece was very educational -- what we need to rethink is the entire war on terror.\n",
      "We have lost thousands of our own men and women, brave soldiers. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries. It is time right now that we bring this world together to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes which are causing these wars.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Senator Sanders, you do often point to your vote against the war in Iraq as evidence of your judgment on foreign policy, but you did vote for the war in Afghanistan. And as recently as , you said you supported a continued U.S. troop presence there. Was that support a mistake?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, only one person, my good friend, Barbara Lee, was right on that issue. She was the only person in the House to vote against the war in Afghanistan. She was right. I was wrong. So was everybody else in the House.\n",
      "But to answer your question, I don't think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at  a.m. in the morning or desert your long-time allies like the Kurds. I think you work with the international community. You remove all troops over a period of time, a short period of time, within one year.\n",
      "NAWAZ: Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in this war, but I want to ask about your decision-making if you were elected commander-in-chief. You have pledged to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan within your first year as president, but the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country.\n",
      "So should you as president still withdraw all those U.S. troops if the country could once again become a haven for terrorists?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We're going to leave one way or the other. The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course, that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement.\n",
      "But, you know, the other day, I was reunited with somebody that I'd served with over there. And the thing we were marveling at is how long it's been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago, and we're still there.\n",
      "There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity, the exact same kind of thing, by the way, that we actually had in Syria holding the line before the president yanked it out, leading to the road to chaos.\n",
      "But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars. And I'm glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned, not only because of what she's talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after /. But right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage to take an up-or-down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place.\n",
      "And when I am president, any time, if I am forced to deploy troops into war, any time we seek an authorization, it will have a three-year sunset, so that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up-or-down vote.\n",

      "Moving to health care, an issue that voters tell us every day is still the number-one priority for them, Senator Sanders, you've spent plenty of time discussing and defending the merits of your Medicare for all plan. But the reality is that if Republicans retain control of the U.S. Senate or even if Democrats win back a narrow Senate majority, your plan as constituted probably would not have the votes to pass Congress.\n",
      "So the question, Senator, is, if Congress rejects your plan and the American people are looking to you for leadership on this issue, are there smaller specific measures that you would take immediately to expand coverage and decrease costs as president?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, Tim, at a time when we're spending twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation, when  million people are uninsured or underinsured, when , people are dying each year because they don't get to a doctor when they should, and when a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have, you know what? I think we will pass a Medicare for all single-payer system, and I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office.\n",
      "Now, to answer your question, I think when we go out to the American people and tell them that right now we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, for example, which in some cases charges us  times more for the same exact drug as is charged in this country, when the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing aids, and does it at a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about, you know what? We're going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind us.\n",
      "ALBERTA: Thank you, Senator Sanders.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, I'd like to bring you in. You spent an awful lot of time  years ago trying to pass a bill far less ambitious than what Senator Sanders is talking about here. Is he being realistic?\n",
      "BIDEN: I don't think it is realistic, but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. Remind everybody,  million people got insurance who didn't have it before. All people with pre-existing conditions were able to be covered. I could go on. We didn't get all that we wanted.\n",
      "But now that it's been exposed, that taking it away has such dire consequences, I've added to the Obamacare plan the Biden initiative, which is a public option, Medicare if you want to have Medicare, reducing significantly the price of drugs, deductibles, et cetera, by -- made by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $ billion, and making sure that we're able to cover everyone who is, in fact, able to be covered.

      "SANDERS: Saying hello.\n",
      "BIDEN: I know. So, look, it covers everybody. It's realistic. And most importantly, it lets you choose what you want. Here you have  million people who negotiated their health care plans with their employer, like many of you have. You may or may not like it. If you don't like it, you can move into the public option that I propose in my plan. But if you like it, you shouldn't have -- you shouldn't have Washington dictating to you, you cannot keep the plan you have.\n",

The average worker in America, their family makes $, a year. That family is now paying $, a year for health care,  percent of their income. Under Medicare for all, that family will be paying $, a year, because we're eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending this byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate health care plans.\n",

      "The idea that you're going to be able to save that person making $, a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. Sixteen percent of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me, you're going to add  percent more and there's not going to be higher taxes? At least before he was honest about it.\n",
      "SANDERS: Joe...\n",
      "BIDEN: It's going to increase personal taxes. There are going to be...\n",
      "SANDERS: That's right, we are going to increase personal taxes. But we're eliminating premiums, we're eliminating co-payments, we're eliminating deductibles, we're eliminating all out-of-pocket expenses, and no family in America will spend more than $ a year on prescription drugs.\n",

      "But where I disagree is, I just don't think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option, to bring the cost down. And, yes, it does bring the costs down immediately for  million people, and then we'll expand coverage to  million people.\n",
      "But here's the political problem. This fight that you guys are having isn't real. Your fight, Bernie, is not with me or with Vice President Biden. It is with all those -- bunch of those new House members, not every one by any means, that got elected in that last election in the Democratic Party. It is with the new governor, Democratic governor of Kentucky, that wants to build on Obamacare.\n",

My fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, with the greed and corruption of the insurance industry. These guys last year made $ billion in profit and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight.\n",
      "The day has got to come -- and Joe is not talking about it, Amy is not talking about it -- the day has got to come, and I will bring that day about, when we finally say to the drug companies and the insurance companies, the function of health care is to provide it for all of our people in a cost-effective way, not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies.\n",

The same question to you that I posed to Senator Sanders, if Congress rejects a Medicare for all proposal and you're the president, are there smaller specific measures that you could pursue with bipartisan support to decrease costs and expand coverage?\n",
      "WARREN: So this is about costs. It's about costs on middle-class families. Last year,  million Americans didn't have a prescription filled because they couldn't afford it. And those are people with health insurance, as well. People who can't do the co-pays, people who can't do the deductibles, people who find out that the drug is not covered.\n",
      "So here's how I approach this. I want to do the most good I can for the most people as quickly as possible. On day one, I'm going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs, like EpiPens and insulin, and bring down those prices. The president can do that -- I love saying this -- all by herself. And I will do it. That's going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars.\n",

      "WARREN: We can do that -- we can do that on  votes.\n",
      "ALBERTA: Thank you, Senator. Judy?\n",
      "WOODRUFF: We are coming to the end of our time. A lot of hands up, we apologize for that.\n",
      "But in the spirit of the season, I'd like to ask each one of you, is there someone else among these candidates that you would -- you have two options, one, a candidate from whom you would ask forgiveness for something maybe that was said tonight or another time, or -- or a candidate to whom you would like to give a gift. And I'm going to start with you, Mr. Yang.\n",
      "YANG: Wow. [laughter]\n",
      "WARREN: We can do a labor action and just all go on strike on this one, Andrew. [laughter]\n",
      "YANG: I don't think I have much to ask forgiveness for. You all can correct me on this. In terms of a gift, Elizabeth has done me the honor of starting to read my book.\n",
      "WARREN: Yes.\n",
      "YANG: I would love to give each of you a copy of my book. [laughter and applause]\n",
      "It's about how we're going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history, the fourth industrial revolution. It is grinding up our communities. And D.C. is out to lunch on this. Our media organizations are not covering it adequately. I wrote a book on it, and if you like data, this book is for you. This goes for the people at home, too, if you like data and books. [laughter]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Mayor Buttigieg. Mayor Buttigieg, ask forgiveness or give a gift?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, I love data and books, so I think we should all be excited about this. And come to think of it, I should probably send my book around more, too. Look...\n",
      "YANG: Your publisher will thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I think all of us will want the same thing at the end of the day. We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of the United States compared to what we've got. [applause]\n",
      "And we've got to remember, there are I don't know how many now -- we're up to  something have run for president in the Democratic president. The moment we've got a nominee, the  who aren't that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does. Let's make sure there's not too much to ask forgiveness for by the time that day comes. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: I will ask for forgiveness. I know that sometimes I get really worked up, and sometimes I get a little hot. I don't really mean to.\n",
      "What happens is, when you do , selfies with people...[laughter]...you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments. You know, I met someone just last week in Nevada who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because he's a veteran. But his sister has diabetes and his daughter has diabetes, and they simply can't afford insulin. So the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people.\n",
      "When I think about what we could do if we get a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, and get back the White House, we could make this country work for people like that man. And that's why I'm in this fight. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: I think everyone up here on this stage, and those who are not on this stage who've run, we owe them, because they're all pushing for the exact same thing. You're not the only one that does selfies, Senator. I've done thousands of them, thousands of them. And the crew that follows me can tell you, there's not one line I go through that I don't have at least a half a dozen people come up and hug me and say, can you help me? I just lost my daughter  days ago. Can you help me? Tell me I'm going to be OK. Can you help me? I just lost -- and they go and lay out their problems.\n",
      "My wife and I have a call list of somewhere between  and  people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them, I'm here. I give them my private phone number. They keep in touch with me.\n",
      "The little kid who says, I can't talk, what do I do? I have scores of these young women and men who I keep in contact with. And the reason I would give everyone here a gift is because they want to do something like I do of making their lives better, because there's a lot of people who are hurting very, very, very badly. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, forgiveness or a gift?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I can give out any one of four books that I wrote. [laughter]\n",
      "But I think the gift that all of us need to give to the American people is a very, very different vision of the reality of the Trump administration. And the vision that we need to bring forth is to create a government and a nation based on love and compassion, not greed and hatred. [applause]\n",
      "We need a vision which says that in our great country, all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living, have health care, have the ability to send their kids to college, regardless of their income. So we need a new vision which brings our people together around an agenda that works for all, not the Trump vision of dividing us up to benefit the billionaire class. That's my vision.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Senator Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, I would ask for forgiveness any time any of you get mad at me. I can be blunt. But I am doing this because I think it is so important to pick the right candidate here. I do.\n",
      "I think when you see what's going on around the country, yes, it's the economic check that Elizabeth and Bernie have so well pointed out on this stage, but there's something else going on here, and it is a decency check. It is a values check. It is a patriotism check.\n",
      "When you see people -- and we've all had this happen -- that come to our meetings and say, you know, yeah, I voted for Donald Trump, but I don't want to do it again, because I want my kids to be able to watch the president on TV and not mute the TV.\n",
      "We have to remember as Democrats, and if I get worked up about this, it's because I believe it so much in my heart, that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out. That is the gift we can give America in this election. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Mr. Steyer?\n",
      "STEYER: So, look, this is the holiday season. And what I'm hearing from every single one of these candidates is that they've gone around the United States and what they've seen from this administration and what they've seen from the Republican Party is cruelty towards the people of the United States for money.\n",
      "So when I think about the gift that I'd like to give -- and I've seen that, too. I mean, I think it starts with cruelty when children are born and it goes right through life into pre-K, education, health care, a living wage. There is cruelty to working people, there is cruelty to seniors.\n",
      "And so the gift that I would like to give everyone on this stage, which was the original question, is the gift of teamwork. Because the question up here is, how are we together going to change this framework? How are we together going to beat this corrupt and criminal president? How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together, not by tearing each other down, but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America? And as a team, that's how we're going to do it. And as Americans, we're going to come together to stand up for the original values -- freedom, equality, justice, teamwork. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: That -- we are going to take a very short break. That does conclude our questions tonight here at Loyola Marymount University. We'll be back in just two minutes to hear the candidates' closing statements.\n",
      "[commercial break]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Welcome back to the PBS NewsHour Democratic debate with Politico. And now it's time for closing statements. Each have  seconds, beginning with Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: I'm different from everybody else on this stage, and here's why. I'm running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people. And for the last  years, that's exactly what I've been doing, taking on unchecked corporate power.\n",
      "That's why I'm for term limits, because if we're going to have bold change, then we need new people in charge and new ideas. I'm the only person on this stage who's built a large, multibillion-dollar international business. I know how to grow prosperity. I can take on Mr. Trump on the economy and beat him.\n",
      "I'm the only one on this stage who said climate is my number-one priority. It's a crisis we have to deal with, but it's also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good-paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where it's so essential.\n",
      "So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold, beat Mr. Trump on the economy, and solve our climate crisis, I can deliver. And I'm asking for your vote.\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Mr. Yang. I'm sorry. My apology for interrupting. [applause]\n",

      "YANG: I know what you're thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them? [applause]\n",
      "Our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser-focused on solving the real problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know. Our country is falling apart.\n",
      "Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We're seeing record high levels of depression and suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger.\n",
      "Our way of life is changing faster than ever, and the simple fact is this. Our politicians in D.C. succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington, D.C., today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions? [laughter]\n",
      "We need to get the money out of D.C. and into your hands, the hands of the American people. Join us at yang.com and help us rewrite the rules of the st century economy to work for us. [applause]\n",
      "WOODRUFF: Thank you. Senator Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: We have had quite a debate tonight, but I want to debate Donald Trump. This primary comes down to some simple questions. Who has the best ideas, the best experience? Mostly, who can beat Donald Trump, and how will she do it?\n",
      "So Donald Trump built his fortune on, over time, over $ million that he got from his dad. My grandpa, he was an iron ore miner, a union member, who worked , feet underground, and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a community college. That's my family trust.\n",
      "And I figure if you are given opportunity, you don't go into the world with a sense of entitlement. You go into it with a sense of obligation, an obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself.\n",
      "Our politics right now, because of Donald Trump, are toxic. We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails, join me. We will win at amyklobuchar.com.\n",

      "Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: So the nominee is going to have to do two things: defeat Donald Trump and unite the country as president. It's a tall order. And in order to do it, we're going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side.\n",
      "I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multigenerational coalition. And I am seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic Party before but belong here now because they're definitely not on board with what's going on in the Trump White House.\n",

One is a Democrat. Two are Republicans. But you know what unites my three brothers? Amazon. They are furious that Amazon reported $ billion in profits and paid zero in taxes.\n",
      "My brothers are part of why America is ready to root out corruption and fight back. And that gives us a base to work from. America is ready for a two cent wealth tax. It's supported by Republicans, Democrats, and independents. And it lets us invest in all of our children.\n",
      "America is ready to expand Social Security payments and disability payments by $ a month. And we can do it. You know, someone asked what this would mean. You just give somebody $ a month, they asked me this in a town hall. And a lady who wanted it said, you know what it will mean to me? It will mean I can get a prescription filled and I can still buy toilet paper the same week. That's where Americans are right now.\n",

      "The truth is that real change always takes place -- real change -- always takes place from the bottom on up, never from the top on down. And that is why in this campaign I am so proud that we have over a million volunteers. We have some of the strongest grassroots organizations. We have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in American history.\n",

      "Look, we all have big progressive plans. And the question is, who can deliver on those plans? And it seems to me, we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly. Who has the best chance, the most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump? Who is the one who's most likely to do that?\n",
      "Number two, who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate in states like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other states?\n",
      "And thirdly, who can deliver legislatively? That requires you to look at our records. I have a significant record of getting significant things done, from Violence Against Women Act to the chemical weapons treaty, in foreign and domestic policy alike.\n",
      "And so I think asking those questions, I believe, as you would expect, that I'm the most qualified to answer those three questions. But most of all, we've got to level with the American people. Don't play games with them. Tell them the truth and be authentic.\n",

      "MADDOW: Hello, and welcome to the MSNBC-Washington Post Democratic candidates debate. At least some of us are very, very happy to be here tonight. I'm Rachel Maddow here in Atlanta, Georgia, tonight with my fellow moderators. Andrea Mitchell is NBC news foreign affairs correspondent and the host of \"Andrea Mitchell Reports\" on MSNBC. Ashley Parker is White House reporter for the Washington Post. And Kristen Welker is NBC News White House correspondent.\n",
      "MITCHELL: We'll be covering a wide range of topics tonight, including national security, race, and climate. Each candidate will have one minute and  seconds to answer our questions and  seconds if we need to follow up. And we ask the audience to respect the candidates and please don't interrupt.\n",
      "MADDOW: There's  candidates here tonight. No time to waste. Let's get right to it.\n",
      "We're in the middle of the fourth presidential impeachment proceedings in our nation's history. Ambassador Gordon Sondland delivered testimony today in the House impeachment inquiry that buttressed the case that President Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with President Zelensky because he wanted the Ukrainian president to announce investigations that would benefit President Trump politically.\n",
      "Senator Warren, you have said already that you've seen enough to convict the president and remove him from office. You and four of your colleagues on this stage tonight who are also U.S. senators may soon have to take that vote. Will you try to convince your Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote the same way? And if so, how?\n",
      "WARREN: Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first, read the Mueller report, all  pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And that's what's happened with Ukraine.\n",
      "We have to establish the principle: no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it.\n",
      "But I want to add one more part based on today's testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what's happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington.\n",
      "You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they're going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I've taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don't ask to be an ambassador, because I'm not going to have that happen.\n",
      "I asked everyone who's running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Warren, thank you.\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar, you've said that you support the impeachment inquiry but you want to wait for a Senate trial to hear the evidence and make a decision about convicting the president. After the bombshell testimony of Ambassador Sondland today, has that view changed for you?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct and I've called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count and make a decision.\n",
      "But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our country's interest, and this is wrong.\n",
      "This is a pattern with this man. And it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers and our workers to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day. That is what this guy does.\n",
      "And I think it is very, very important that we have a president that's going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum. And on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect. And he said this: We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. We told the truth, we obeyed the law, we kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a president of the United States.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, I'd like to go to you. Americans are watching these impeachment hearings. At the same time, they're also focused on their more immediate, daily economic and family concerns. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by this impeachment inquiry be to any Democratic nominee's campaign for president? How central would it be to yours?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We're going to lose the election.\n",
      "Right now, you've got  million people who have no health insurance or are underinsured. We're facing the great existential crisis of our time in terms of climate change. You've got , people sleeping out on the street and you've got  million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing.\n",
      "What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump's corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.\n",
      "MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, let me put the same question to you. How central should the president's conduct uncovered by the impeachment inquiry be to a Democratic nominee's campaign? How central would it be to yours?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics. And it is not a part of the campaign. But the president's conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen in the abuse of power that we're learning more about in the investigations -- but just to be clear, the president's already confessed to it on television. But that's just part of what we've seen.\n",
      "Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we're also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump presidency comes to an end one way or the other.\n",
      "I'm running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever and, while doing it, address big issues that didn't take a vacation for the impeachment process or for the Trump presidency as a whole: a climate approaching the point of no return, the fact we've still got to act on health care, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold on to what they've got.\n",
      "MADDOW: Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president and will be at the heart of our campaign.\n",
      "MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Andrea?\n",
      "MITCHELL: Vice President Biden, you've suggested in your campaign that if you defeat President Trump, Republicans will start working with Democrats again. But right now, Republicans in Congress, including some of whom you've worked with for decades, are demanding investigations not only of you but also of your son. How would you get those same Republicans to work with you?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, look, the next president of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, that's number one. And, number two, going to have to be able make be -- be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority. That's what I'll do.\n",
      "You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place? And, secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the House and in the Senate?\n",
      "And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned, number one, that Donald Trump doesn't want me to be the nominee. That's pretty clear. He held up aid to make sure that -- while at the same time innocent people in the Donbas are getting killed by Russian soldiers.\n",
      "Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn't want me to be president. So I -- I've learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that -- that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question: Who is most likely to do what needs to be done, produce a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?\n",
      "MITCHELL: Senator Harris, your thoughts about that?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House. And there is no question that in  the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.\n",
      "And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the president, from what we heard today, the vice president, the secretary of state, and the chief of staff.\n",
      "And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue, and back to the question that you asked earlier, which is, what does this mean for the American people?\n",
      "Because what it means, when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America: the powerful people who with their arrogance think they can get away with this and then everybody else.\n",
      "Because here's the thing. For those working people who are working two or three jobs, if they don't pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who don't pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody. And part of the reason I'm running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people, and not just for some.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Senator Warren, you have cast yourself as a fighter. If you were elected, though, you would be walking into an existing fight, a country that is already very divided over the Trump presidency, among other things. Do you see that divide as permanent? Or do you need to bring the country together if you become president to achieve your goals?\n",
      "WARREN: So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks.\n",
      "You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than $ billion in assets, your first $ billion is free and clear. But your  billionth and first dollar, you've got to pitch in  cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, you've got to pinch in a few pennies more.\n",
      "Here's the thing. Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It's about saying, you built something great in this country? Good for you. But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You did it using -- you're getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.\n",
      "So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one tenth of one percent big, pitch in two cents so everybody else gets a chance to make it.\n",
      "And here's the thing. That's something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about, because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and say we're going to make real change.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.\n",
      "Senator Booker, do you agree with that strategy?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats. And I don't agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue.\n",
      "But here's the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well.\n",
      "When I stood in church recently and asked folks in a black church how many people here want to be entrepreneurs, half the church raised their hands. If we as a country don't start -- if we as a party don't start talking not just about how to tax wealth, but how to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream -- because, yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $ an hour.\n",
      "But the people in communities I frequent, they're not -- aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity. And that's what our party has to be about, as well.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Senator Warren, you wanted to respond?\n",
      "WARREN: Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one-tenth of one percent in this country, and we can provide universal child care for every baby in this country ages zero to five. That is transformative.\n",
      "We can provide universal pre-K for every -year-old and -year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women, who do this work. And we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre-schoolteacher in America.\n",
      "We can put $ billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $ billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for  percent of the folks who've got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generation's future.\n",
      "MITCHELL: All right. Let me let Senator Booker respond.\n",
      "WARREN: Sure.\n",
      "BOOKER: You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. We're all united in wanting to see universal preschool. And I'll fight for that. We're all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for two parents that went to HBCUs.\n",
      "But the tax the way we're putting it forward right now, the wealth tax, I'm sorry, it's cumbersome. It's been tried by other nations. It's hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation.\n",
      "But, again, we as Democrats have got to start talking not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it. Look at VC dollars in this country. Seventy-five percent of them go to three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas.\n",
      "If I am president of the United States, we're going to have a fair, just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but, dear God, we're going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. We're going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "BOOKER: We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Senator Warren, briefly, just your last thoughts on this.\n",

      "BOOKER: I'm not disagreeing with that.\n",
      "WARREN: The top one-tenth of one percent that I want to say pay two cents more, they'll pay . percent in America. I'm tired of freeloading billionaires. I think it's time that we ask those at the very top to pay more so that every single one of our children gets a real...\n",

      "Mayor Buttigieg, you have said, quote, \"I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point.\" The Republican Party never stopped fighting President Obama in his eight years in office. So what would you do that President Obama didn't do to change that?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even  years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment we're in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues that didn't exist in the same way even a few years ago.\n",
      "Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing, if we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on health care, the reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal health care is that that is something that as a governing strategy we can unify the American people around, creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not.\n",
      "And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years, as Senator Warren has proposed, or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "Kristen Welker?\n",
      "WELKER: Let's talk about Medicare for all. Senator Warren, you are running on Medicare for all. Democrats have been winning elections even in red states with a very different message on health care: protecting Obamacare. Democrats are divided on this issue. What do you say to voters who are worried that your position on Medicare for all could cost you critical votes in the general election?\n",
      "WARREN: So I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills,  million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just can't afford it, people who didn't take the tests the doctor recommended because they just can't afford it.\n",
      "So here is my plan. Let's bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can as fast as we can. On day one as president, I will do -- bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. That's going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people. I'm going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration.\n",
      "And in the first  days, I want to bring in  million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of , everybody who has a family of four income less than $,. I want to lower the age of Medicare to  and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and long-term care.\n",
      "And then in the third year, when people have had a chance to feel it and taste it and live with it, we're going to vote and we're going to want Medicare for all.\n",
      "WELKER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, let me bring you into this conversation and ask you the question...\n",
      "SANDERS: Thank you. I wrote the damn bill. [laughter]\n",
      "WELKER: I want to ask you the question this way, Senator Sanders. You described your campaign, including your plans for Medicare for all, as a political revolution.\n",
      "SANDERS: Yes.\n",
      "WELKER: President Obama explicitly said the country is, quote, \"less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. The average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,\" end quote. Is President Obama wrong?\n",
      "SANDERS: No, he's right. We don't have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current health care system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional.\n",
      "Now, you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we've got  million uninsured, underinsured. In some cases, we pay  times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada or other countries. Five hundred thousand people go bankrupt because of medically related issues. They come down with cancer, and that's a reason to go bankrupt?\n",
      "Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR and if you think back to JFK and Harry Truman and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about health care for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time.\n",
      "And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all. Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses. That's where we've got to go.\n",
      "WELKER: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: You know, we can do this without charging people -- raising $ trillion, $ trillion. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all.\n",
      "SANDERS: Not true.\n",
      "BIDEN: It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who doesn't think it makes sense.\n",
      "We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose, I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. A hundred and sixty million people like their private insurance. And if they don't like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board.\n",
      "But here's the deal, they get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest and not demand of them what the insurance companies -- they want no -- no competition. And my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all.\n",

It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military industrial complex, and other greedy corporate interests.\n",
      "I'm running for president to be the Democratic nominee that rebuilds our Democratic Party, takes it out of their hands, and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who are calling for an end to this ongoing Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm's way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security and have cost us thousands of American lives.\n",
      "These are wars that have cost us as American taxpayers trillions of dollars since / alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs. As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard-earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving the needs of the American people right here at home.\n",

      "GABBARD: That's ridiculous, Senator Harris. That's ridiculous.\n",
      "HARRIS: ... who has spent full time -- who has spent full time criticizing people on this stage as affiliated with the Democratic Party, when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the Democratic Party.\n",

      "Congresswoman Gabbard, I'll give you a chance to respond.\n",
      "GABBARD: What Senator Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I'm seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will as president continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive.\n",
      "This is personal to me because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in the medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as commander-in-chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always -- no, I'm not going to put party interests first. I will put the interests of the American people above all else.\n",

Senator, should Democrats discourage this? Or are you OK with it?\n",

And what the American people are saying: Nobody is above the law. And I think what the American people are also saying is, in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law.\n",

When President Ford pardoned President Nixon, he said it was to heal the country. Would you support a potential criminal investigation into President Trump after he leaves office, even if you thought it might further inflame the country's divisions?\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, I would not direct my Justice Department like this president does. I'd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. That's not the role of the president of the United States. It's the attorney general of the United States, not the president's attorney, private attorney.\n",
      "And so I would -- whatever was determined by the attorney general I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be, in fact, criminally prosecuted, then so be it. But I would not direct it.\n",
      "And I don't think it's a good idea that we mock -- that we model ourselves after Trump and say lock him up. Look, we have to bring this country together. Let's start talking civilly to people and treating -- you know, the next president starts tweeting should -- anyway. [laughter]\n",
      "Look, it's just -- look, it's about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country. And that's not who we are, that's not who we've been, that's not who we should be. Follow the law, let the Justice Department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me ask you briefly to respond to that, the difference of opinion there with Vice President Biden.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, I think Joe is right. I think that it is the function of the attorney general. But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he's above the law. We have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who's violated the emoluments clause.\n",
      "I think Joe is right, that is the function of an independent Department of Justice. But my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law.\n",
      "BIDEN: Can I respond very quickly?\n",
      "MADDOW: Briefly, Senator.\n",
      "BIDEN: Distinction, should he be impeached and should he be thrown out of office? That's one question. He's very close to -- he's indicted himself. Number two, after he's thrown out of office or after he's defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? That's a judgment to be made by an attorney general.\n",
      "MADDOW: Mr. Vice President, thank you.\n",
      "Ashley?\n",
      "PARKER: We now focus on an issue facing many Americans, childcare and paid family leave. Here in Georgia, the average price of infant daycare can be as much as $, per child per year. That's more than instate tuition at a four-year public college in Georgia. Mr. Yang, what would you do as president to ease that financial burden?\n",
      "YANG: There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list. And we need to get off this list as soon as possible. [laughter]\n",
      "I would pass paid family leave as one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs, and it's breaking families' backs. We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning, because by the time they're showing up to pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, they're already years behind.\n",
      "Studies have shown that two-thirds of our kids' educational outcomes are determined by what's happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words read to them as children, type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them.\n",
      "So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $, a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases $, a month into families' pockets, so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child. We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that tradeoff and say if they leave the home and work, they're going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway. In many cases, it would be better if the parent stays home with the child.\n",
      "PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Yang. [applause]\n",
      "Sticking with this topic, no parent in the United States is federally guaranteed a single day of paid leave when they have a new baby. A number of you on stage tonight have plans to address this. Senator Harris, you're one of the candidates proposing legislation to guarantee up to six months of paid family leave. And Senator Klobuchar, you're one of the candidates proposing up to three months. I want to hear from both of you on this, starting with you, Senator Klobuchar. Why three months?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I've looked at this economically, and I want to make sure that we help people. Because as just pointed out, we are way behind the curve, our country is, when it comes to providing paid family leave and childcare. We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big.\n",
      "But what I have done with all of my plans is I have shown how I'm going to pay for them meticulously. I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the White House right now one who has told over , lies.\n",
      "So when you look at my website, at amyklobuchar.com, you will see my plans and you're also going to see how I'm going to pay for it. And I think that is so important, because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino, and really putting this country in a worst financial situation every single day.\n",
      "So, yes, my plan is three months. I think that's good. I'd love to do more. As I've said before, I'd love to staple free diplomas under people's chairs. I just am not going to go for things -- and this is not -- I'm talking about Senator Harris' plan here, but I'm talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.\n",
      "I think that we have an obligation -- we have an obligation as a party to be, yes, fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but make sure we have people's backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for. And that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I don't support, to kicking  million off their health insurance -- current health insurance in four years.\n",
      "PARKER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I just think we have to be smart about how we do this.\n",
      "PARKER: Thank you, Senator. And, Senator Harris, why six months? And also, how would you pay for that?\n",
      "HARRIS: Sure. And, everybody, please visit my website, kamalaharris.org, for the details on everything I talk about. Six months, so part of how I believe we're going to win this election is, it is going to be because we are focused on the future, we are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow.\n",
      "So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their s. People are having children in their s, often in their s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents, which requires a lot of work, from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare to all of the activities that are required, much less the health care needs that are required.\n",
      "And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether they're going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of women's lives today.\n",
      "The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We passed the Equal Pay Act in , but fast forward to the year of our lord , and women are paid  cents on the dollar, black women  cents, Native American women  cents, Latinas  cents.\n",
      "PARKER: Thank you.\n",
      "HARRIS: So my policy is about -- there's a whole collection of the work that I am doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and, therefore, the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed.\n",
      "PARKER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Kristen?\n",
      "WELKER: Mr. Steyer, millions of working Americans are finding that housing has become unaffordable, especially in metropolitan areas. It is particularly acute in your home state of California, in places like Los Angeles and San Francisco. Why are you the best person to fix this problem?\n",
      "STEYER: When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school. It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work.\n",
      "What we've seen in California is, as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units. And that affects everybody in California. It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents which affect every single working person in the state of California.\n",
      "I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units.\n",
      "But the other thing that's going to be true about building these units is, we're going to have to build them in a way that's sustainable, that, in fact, how we build units, where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability.\n",
      "So we are going to have to direct dollars, we're going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities who have worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and we're going to have force it, and then we're going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending  percent of their income on rent.\n",
      "WELKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Warren, I see your hand raised.\n",
      "WARREN: Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side, and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time ago, affordable housing.\n",
      "Also, private developers, they've gone up to McMansions. They're not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers.\n",
      "So I've got a plan for . million new housing units in America. Those are housing units for working families, for the working poor, for the poor poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who are coming back from being incarcerated. It's about tenants' rights.\n",
      "But there's one more piece. Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people you're cut out of the deal. That was known as red-lining.\n",
      "When I built a housing plan, it's not only a housing plan about building new units. It's a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government-sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it, and we need to say we're going to reverse it.\n",
      "WELKER: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker? [applause]\n",
      "BOOKER: I'm so grateful, again, as a mayor who was a mayor during a recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis, who started my career as a tenants' rights lawyer, these are all good points, but we're not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low-income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation.\n",
      "And so all these things we need to put more federal dollars in it, but we've got to start empowering people. We use our tax code to move wealth up, the mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If you're a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount you're paying and the area median rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners.\n",
      "And what that does is it actually slashes poverty,  million people out. And by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord, it is also low-income families struggling to stay in their homes.\n",

      "American farmers are struggling under the effects of President Trump's trade war with China. The Trump administration's payments to farmers to offset those losses already have a price tag that is more than double what was spent on the Obama administration's auto bailout.\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, would you continue those farm subsidies?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We shouldn't have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn't have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago, I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said I got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.\n",
      "By the way, this isn't even making farmers whole. If you're in soybeans, for example, you're getting killed. And it's not just what this president has done with the trade war. In a lot of parts of the country, the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who are involved in ethanol.\n",
      "Look, I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more I'm talking to people in rural America who see that they're not going to benefit from business as usual under this president.\n",
      "I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them, not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to.\n",
      "And American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change. I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And it's an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution, including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging they're part of the problem.\n",
      "MADDOW: Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to answer the question. Would you continue those subsidies or not?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yes, but we won't need them because we're going to fix the trade war.\n",

      "The U.N. recently reported that what was once called climate change is now a climate crisis, with drastic results already being felt. Climate is also an issue important to our audience. We received thousands of questions from our viewers, and many of them were about climate.\n",
      "Calista from Minneapolis writes this. Leading the world in resolving the climate crisis will be a multi-decade project, spanning far beyond even a two-term presidency. If you are elected president, how would you ensure that there is secure leadership and bipartisan support to continue this project?\n",
      "Congresswoman Gabbard?\n",
      "GABBARD: This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or a Republican issue. This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face. These are the kinds of conversations that we're having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together, saying, hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that we're able to raise our kids in a community that's safe.\n",
      "It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $ billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry, instead investing in a green renewable energy economy that leads us into the st century with good-paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure, and transitioning our agriculture -- that is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face -- towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and well-being of our people, leading as a -- as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats.\n",
      "MADDOW: Thank you. Thank you, Congresswoman. I want to bring in Mr. Steyer on this. You've made climate change a central point of your political career. To this issue of making change -- changes that last, making changes that are permanent, could you address that, sir?\n",
      "STEYER: Rachel, I'm the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number-one priority for me. Vice President Biden won't say it. Senator Warren won't say it. It's a state of emergency, and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency.\n",
      "I know that we have to do this. I've spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this.\n",
      "I would make this the number-one priority of my foreign policy, as well. We can do this and create literally millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low-income black and brown communities. And when we ask, how are we going to pull this country together, how about this: We take on the biggest challenge in history, we save the world, and we do it together. Do you think that would pull America together? I do.\n",
      "MADDOW: Quickly, Vice President Biden, you were name-checked there. I'd like to give you a chance to respond.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. It's the number-one issue. And I might add, I don't really need a kind of a lecture from -- from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that PolitiFact said was a game-changer, while I managed the $ billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time we've ever done it, my friend was introducing more coal mines and produced more coal around the world, according to the press, than all of Great Britain produces.\n",
      "Now, he's -- I welcome him back into the fold here, and he's been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, let's get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of all time.\n",

      "STEYER: Look, I came to the conclusion over  years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and it was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels. And we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago.\n",
      "If we're waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills -- and I know everybody on this stage cares about this. But Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever. This is a problem which continues to get worse. That's why I'm saying it's a state of emergency. That's why I'm saying it's priority one. If it isn't priority one, it's not going to get done.\n",
      "And this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront. We have to make it the most important thing. And we can use it to rebuild and reimagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water and create millions of good-paying jobs.\n",

      "Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question, because your question has said, what are we going to do in decades? We don't have decades. What the scientists are telling us, if we don't get our act together within the next eight or nine years, we're talking about cities all over the world, major cities going underwater, we're talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances.\n",

      "What we have got to do tonight, and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable, because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that their carbon products were destroying the planet, and maybe we should think about prosecuting them, as well.\n",

      "MITCHELL: President Trump has dramatically changed America's approach to our adversaries by holding summits with Kim Jong Un, getting out of the Iran nuclear deal, and at times embracing Vladimir Putin and other strongmen. So let's talk about what kind of commander-in-chief you would be.\n",
      "Senator Harris, North Korea is now threatening to cancel any future summits if President Trump does not make concessions on nuclear weapons. If you were commander-in-chief, would you make concessions to Kim Jong-un in order to keep those talks going?\n",
      "HARRIS: With all due deference to the fact that this is presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked. He was -- he has conducted foreign policy since day one born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander-in-chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland. [applause]\n",
      "And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation -- and therefore, an extension of our ability to be secure -- is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.\n",
      "What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment.\n",
      "MITCHELL: But would you make concessions to North Korea to keep talks...\n",
      "HARRIS: Not at this point. There are no concessions to be made. They -- he has traded a photo-op for nothing. He has abandoned the -- by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year-and-a-half, so those operations, which should be -- and those exercises, which should be active, because they are in our best national security, the relationship that we have with Japan, he has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea's nuclear program.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Mr. Vice President, President Trump inherited the North Korea problem from past presidents, over decades. What would a President Biden do that President Obama didn't do in eight years?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, first of all, I'd go back in making sure we had the alliances we had before since he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they wanted, creating the legitimacy by having a meeting with Kim Jong-un, who's a thug -- although he points out that I'm a rabid dog who needs to be beaten with a stick, very recently was his comment.\n",
      "SANDERS: But other than that, you like him.\n",

      "And in Japan and Australia, and being a Pacific power, and putting pressure on China in order -- for them to make sure that it is a non -- it is a nuclear-free peninsula. And the way we do that is, we make clear to China, which I have done personally with -- with the president of China, and that is we're going to move up our defenses, we're going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea, and if they view that as a threat, it's an easy thing to respond to. They, in fact, can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea.\n",
      "But the fact is that we're in a position where he has done this across the world. He's embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is -- his whole effort is to break up NATO, to increase his power. Look what he's done to -- and so this guy has no idea what he's doing. He has no notion how to go about it.

We used a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. And so at the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer, and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies we would need to show strength against China.\n",
      "There's a larger battle going on, on the planet Earth right now between totalitarian, dictatorial countries and free democracies. And we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government, with its leader now getting rid of even his -- getting rid of term limits.\n",

      "But not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights. Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. It's a human right violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization for the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with and begin to check China, check Putin, and the other folks that are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe.\n",
      "MADDOW: Thank you, Senator. Andrea?\n",
      "MITCHELL: Mr. Vice President, the CIA has concluded that the leader of Saudi Arabia directed the murder of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The State Department also says the Saudi government is responsible for executing nonviolent offenders and for torture. President Trump has not punished senior Saudi leaders. Would you?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, and I said it at the time. Khashoggi was, in fact, murdered and dismembered, and I believe on the order of the crown prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them, we were going to, in fact, make them pay the price and make them, in fact, the pariah that they are. There's very little social redeeming value of the -- in the present government in Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "And I would also, as pointed out, I would end -- end subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis where they're going in and murdering children, and they're murdering innocent people. And so they have to be held accountable.\n",
      "And with regard to China, we should -- look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China, what they're doing with the million Uighurs that are there, essentially in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally, vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong. We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Senator Klobuchar, just to follow up, would you go against the Saudis, even though that would potentially help Iran, their adversaries?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: We need a new foreign policy in this country, and that means renewing our relationships with our allies. It means rejoining international agreements. And it means reasserting our American values.\n",
      "And so when the president did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the country that -- across the world that that was OK, and that's wrong.\n",
      "And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said, first of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene, but the president precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating, even though they were cheating, for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty.\n",
      "And when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long term, like I do, just like the Chinese do, because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet, and they are in it for the long game.\n",
      "MITCHELL: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which does everything it can to crush democracy, treats women as third-class citizens. And when we rethink our American foreign policy, what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally.\n",
      "We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say we are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.\n",
      "And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel. But we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve. [applause]\n",
      "What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is  percent or  percent, is unsustainable. So we need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with the United Nations, and not continue to support brutal dictatorships.\n",

      "It's how we help bring our nation together. It's how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. It's also about how families share that sacrifice.\n",
      "I remember what it was like when I was a little girl. My brother, my oldest brother, who served five-and-a-half years off and on in combat in Vietnam, what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed? How is he doing? And if there was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if there wasn't, she would say, well, maybe tomorrow.\n",
      "This is about building for our entire nation. And I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country. So, for example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in , people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change. We can do this as a nation.\n",
      "MADDOW: Thank you, Senator. In President Trump's first two years in office, the Pentagon budget ballooned. Mayor Buttigieg, would you cut military spending? Or would you keep it on the same upward trajectory?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: We need to re-prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. It's not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway growth in military spending. It's also where.\n",
      "Right now, we are spending a fraction of the attention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turned into bigger targets.\n",

FBI Director Christopher Wray recently told Congress, quote, \"The majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by white supremacist violence.\"\n",
      "Congresswoman Gabbard, to you. As president, would you direct the federal government to do something about this problem that it is not currently doing?\n",
      "GABBARD: Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness, and attacks that unfortunately have taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. It's important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.\n",
      "This is something that I'll do as president and commander-in-chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs, end the money bail system, enact the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past.\n",
      "The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, orientation, and our politics. That kind of leadership starts at the top. As president, I will usher in a st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost.\n",

      "Mr. Yang, what would you do about the issue of white supremacist violence?\n",

      "I talked to an anti-hate activist named Christian Picciolini who told me about how he was radicalized over a -year period. He said he was a lonely -year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade. Now he's out and he's helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society.\n",
      "But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken -year-old boy, he would have gone with them. He said if it had been a coach, I would have gone with him, if it had been a mentor or a teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.\n",
      "So what we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country,  percent-plus of the shooters we're talking about are young boys and young men. We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in today's economy.\n",

      "Vice President Biden, the \"Me, Too\" movement has forced a cultural reckoning around the issue of sexual violence and harassment against women in America. Are there specific actions that you would take early in your administration to address this problem?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes. And by the way, it's one of the reasons -- the first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote. The fact -- I didn't write the reauthorization. I wrote the original act.\n",
      "The fact is that what happens now is that we, in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated. That's why as vice president -- and when I asked the president, I could start the movement on the college campuses to say it's on us. It's everyone's responsibility.\n",
      "We do not spend nearly enough time dealing with -- I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me , people were on the call, young people between  and , and found out I said, what do you need -- what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and on your schools? You know what they said? Get men involved, engage the rest of the community.\n",
      "And that's when we started this movement on the college campuses to fundamentally change the culture. No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger, other than in self-defense, and that's -- rarely ever occurs. And so we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching at it. It will be a big -- no, I really mean it. It's a gigantic issue. And we have to make it clear from the top, from the president on down, that we will not tolerate it. We will not tolerate this culture.\n",

What exactly prompted you to say that, Senator Harris?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, I was asked a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published. But, listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue, and I'll speak to the larger issue. I believe that the mayor has made apologies for that.\n",
      "The larger issue is that for too long I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies and have -- you know, they show up when it's, you know, close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote, but just haven't been there before.\n",
      "I mean, you know, the -- there are plenty of people who applauded black women for the success of the  election, applauded black women for the election of a senator from Alabama.

And what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are? [applause]\n",
      "And I'm running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks. And we've got to re-create the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, that's people of color, that's our LGBTQ community, that's working people, that's our labor unions.

      "And before I share what's in my plans, let me talk about what's in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory.\n",
      "I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society.\n",
      "And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn't have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.\n",

      "And so the issue really is not what is the fight. The issue has to be, how are we going to win? And to win, we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because that's the last time we won.\n",
      "And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities, and has the ability to bring people together. And everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and, therefore, ability to bring folks together around our commonalities, of which I believe there are many.\n",
      "WELKER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Senator Warren, quickly?\n",
      "WARREN: So I think it is really important that we actually talk about what we're willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris rightly raised the question of economic justice.\n",
      "Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now in America, African-Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they're in college, and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out,  years out, whites who borrowed money,  percent of them have paid off their student loan debt,  percent of African-Americans have paid it off.\n",
      "I believe that means everyone on this stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let's do something tangible and real to make change in this country.\n",

      "WARREN: If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border.\n",
      "Trump is the one who has created this crisis, and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid. That means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity.\n",
      "You know, when I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border. I went down there immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There's like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys.\n",
      "I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers, and she told me she'd given a drink to a police officer and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border.\n",

      "Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they're worried. They're pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote. And they're worried because the Democratic Party, we don't want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that doesn't -- isn't trusted, doesn't have authentic connection.\n",
      "And so that's what's on the ballot. And issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week, I hear him literally say that I don't think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it. [laughter]\n",
      "And let me tell you, because -- because marijuana -- marijuana -- marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it's -- the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people. [applause]\n",
      "And so let me just -- let me just say this. With more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since , do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children, because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people -- our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes. [applause]\n",

      "PARKER: Quickly. Quickly, please.\n",
      "BOOKER: We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive diminution -- a lot of reasons, but there was a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers.\n",
      "PARKER: Thank you, Senator Booker. Vice President Biden, you can respond to that.\n",
      "BIDEN: I'll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think everyone -- anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged, be completely zeroed out.\n",
      "But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That's all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged.\n",
      "Secondly, I'm -- you know, I'm part of that Obama coalition. I come out of a black community, in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that's ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people...\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and of leading  of the bills that are in that House-passed bill you just referred to.\n",
      "And I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I've got to the Senate. And I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task, a bipartisan bill to say, yeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they're paid for, and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have  states that don't have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill. And I am so close to getting it done. And the way I get it done is if I'm president.\n",
      "But just like I have won statewide and mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official, and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: So, first of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There's more than  years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\n",
      "I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces, and our marriages. And I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late.\n",

      "GABBARD: Thank you. I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. I've introduced legislation called the Securing Americas Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voter's voice is heard.\n",
      "But I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comments about experience. Pete, you'll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander-in-chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.\n",
      "As commander-in-chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience, serving for seven years in Congress, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands...\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: So I've got to respond to that. I know that it's par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of today's politics.\n",
      "GABBARD: Are you saying that you didn't say that?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. We've been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years, with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships, for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? [laughter]\n",
      "GABBARD: That's not what I said. That's not what I said.\n",

One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not since it wasn't accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that.

      "BUTTIGIEG: No.\n",
      "GABBARD: But your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment. And what you've just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Like Donald Trump who met with Kim.\n",

      "SANDERS: To your original point, the American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt. And it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United which allows billionaires to buy elections.\n",

I don't mean to change the subject, but I think it's sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in  but have a sweeping victory across the country. And what that's going to mean is turnout.\n",
      "In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people don't vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote?\n",
      "But what we've found at NextGen America is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. And if you look at  and flipping the House, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three-quarters. In the  congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people, the turnout went up by more than  percent, more than double.\n",

It reminded me of Army counsel years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, \"Have you no sense of decency, sir?\"\n",

And when you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn't vote in , African-Americans are turning out like we didn't see before. But we also -- and they must be with us, and we must get our fired-up Democratic base with us.\n",

      "LACEY: Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive  seconds to answer questions,  seconds for responses and rebuttals, and  seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.\n",
      "COOPER: And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let's begin.\n",
      "Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn't it be the voters who determine the president's fate?\n",
      "WARREN: Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry.\n",
      "When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all  pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.\n",
      "Now, that didn't happen. And look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.\n",
      "Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.\n",

      "SANDERS: No, they don't. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller Report. I think that the House will find him guilty of — worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.\n",
      "And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\n",
      "COOPER: Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, \"The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.\" With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?\n",
      "BIDEN: Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.\n",
      "This president — and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders — is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.\n",
      "COOPER: Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, it's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.\n",
      "During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.\n",
      "Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.\n",
      "But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.\n",
      "COOPER: Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's, quote, \"moral vandalism\" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.\n",
      "BOOKER: So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.\n",
      "Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart.\n",
      "Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you, Senator Booker.\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar, you have — what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, health care, the economy, and could backfire on Democrats?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.\n",
      "He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that.\n",
      "So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.\n",
      "It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers' issues, whether it is farmers' issues, he has put his own private interests …\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: … and I will not do that.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction?\n",
      "CASTRO: Not at all. We can walk and chew gun at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.\n",
      "Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out  different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly — in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power.\n",
      "We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.\n",
      "COOPER: Mayer Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There's been, obviously, very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans, who enable the president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.\n",
      "Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It's also about the presidency itself, because a president  years or  years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.\n",
      "But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.\n",
      "It starts out feeling like a happy thought; this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we'll be: vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.\n",
      "I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House member on this stage. How do you respond?\n",
      "GABBARD: If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we're already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in .\n",
      "The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.\n",
      "If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman.\n",
      "Mr. Steyer, you've been calling for impeachment for two years. Does there need to be bipartisan support?\n",
      "STEYER: Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House. [applause]\n",
      "But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at  Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They're the voice that counts, and that's who I went to, the American people.\n",
      "COOPER: Mr. Yang, do you think there's already enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond.\n",
      "YANG: I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in . We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.\n",
      "Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of , manufacturing jobs in your towns. And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands.\n",
      "It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing  percent of America's stores and malls, soaking up $ billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.\n",
      "The fact is, Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.\n",
      "COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: You know, I think about everyone who's ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight in Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard, those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice.\n",
      "And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you, Congressman.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: If we do not hold him to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country, but we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: And we cannot do that.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.\n",
      "Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it's not okay for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.\n",
      "And what I wanted to make a point about — and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.\n",
      "On the — look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions — three occasions — has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.\n",
      "Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\n",
      "UNKNOWN: Anderson — Anderson …\n",
      "COOPER: Hold on, sorry, just to follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer.\n",
      "BIDEN: Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.\n",
      "My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.\n",
      "COOPER: Senator Sanders, your response?\n",
      "SANDERS: Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that  million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.\n",
      "But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.\n",
      "COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mark?\n",
      "LACEY: We want to move now to the economy.\n",
      "UNKNOWN: May I get in, please?\n",

      "LACEY: Thank you. We're going to -- Senator Warren.\n",
      "UNKNOWN: It is wrong to move on.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt. And you've said how you're going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?\n",
      "WARREN: So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is, I have been out all around this country. I've done  town halls now, been to  states and Puerto Rico. Shoot, I've done , selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.\n",
      "And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.\n",
      "And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.\n",
      "Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if your mom has diabetes, or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with MS. But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your health care after that.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?\n",
      "WARREN: So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.\n",
      "LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, \"evasive\" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all. What's your response?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\n",
      "No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is, we really can deliver health care for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.\n",
      "But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes-or-no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare. We let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that, too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your health care and for your family. And it can be delivered without an increase on the middle-class taxes.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response?\n",
      "WARREN: So, let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.\n",
      "Medicare for all is the gold standard. It is the way we get health care coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who's just gotten an MS diagnosis. That's how we make sure that everyone gets health care.\n",
      "We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.\n",
      "I've been studying this, you know, for the biggest part of my life...\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Can the -- can the...\n",
      "WARREN: ... why people go bankrupt.\n",
      "LACEY: ... mayor respond?\n",
      "WARREN: Sure.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.\n",
      "And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking  million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big, bold goal -- and once again, we have a president -- we're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders?\n",
      "WARREN: I'd like to be able to respond...\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do.\n",
      "At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less -- substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, at least that's a straightforward answer, but there's a better way.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?\n",
      "WARREN: So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, \"Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.\"\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar...\n",
      "WARREN: \"We're not covering what you need.\"\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.\n",
      "I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking  million people off their insurance in our years.\n",
      "And I'm tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that's going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold, that will cover more people, and it's the one we should get behind.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: You know, I didn't spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question, and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of health care.\n",
      "And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of health care. And, look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I've put out nearly  plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part is that is we have got to stop...\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "WARREN: ... Americans from going bankrupt over health care costs.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.\n",
      "But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times, is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. That is long-term care. We are seeing -- I once called it a silver tsunami. The aging -- and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge -- the aging of the population.\n",
      "We need to make easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio, that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Those are the issues that I hear about when I'm in Toledo.\n",

      "HARRIS: I'd like to be...\n",
      "LACEY: Let me -- let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?\n",
      "BIDEN: First of all, the plan we're hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I built forward. Build on Obamacare, add a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like.\n",
      "But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $ trillion over  years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.\n",
      "And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that, in fact, it will reduce costs. But for people making between $, and $, a year, their taxes are going to go up about $,, because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, . percent plus, or  percent, plus a  percent income tax. If you're making -- if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $, a year, their taxes are going to go up about $,. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to -- we were coming to you.\n",
      "SANDERS: I get a little bit tired -- I must say -- of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel,  million uninsured, , people dying every single year, , people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.\n",
      "I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $ billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. [applause]\n",
      "And if we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\n",

      "And it's outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.\n",

      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "BURNETT: I want to turn now to jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next  years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit.\n",
      "Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?\n",
      "SANDERS: Damn right we will. And I'll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put  million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera.\n",
      "Furthermore -- and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight -- this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to  million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\n",
      "We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition fee and cancelling student debt, we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $, a month better than Sanders' plan to guaranteeing them a job?\n",
      "YANG: I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job? What if you're not good at your job?\n",
      "The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.\n",
      "Also, Senator Sanders, the description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $, a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.\n",
      "Because the fact is -- and you know this in Ohio -- if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $, a month, are those the best solutions there? Please respond.\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, I'm happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great -- as a great New Jersian, Yogi Berra, said, \"I am having deja vu all over again.\"\n",
      "I'm having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. And the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office. [applause]\n",
      "And I'm having deja vu all over again. And I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another health care debate, and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.

      "BURNETT: Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight.\n",
      "Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, \"a good story, except it's not really true.\" So should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?\n",
      "WARREN: So the data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.\n",
      "I have a plan to fix that, and it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly,  percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?\n",

      "CASTRO: Well, I think -- I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? You know, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I'm even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work.\n",
      "But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.\n",
      "I was in Newton, Iowa, a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa, had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They're putting hundreds of people to work at decent-paying jobs and creating a better future for those families.\n",
      "On top of that, let me just say this. We need to support working families. We need to invest in things like...\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\n",
      "CASTRO: ... universal childcare, so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay  percent of their income for it.\n",

      "YANG: Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in  states, including this one; . million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.\n",
      "What is that going to mean for the . million truckers or the  million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.\n",

      "WARREN: So I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It's one of the reasons that I've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $ to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.\n",
      "That $ a month will lift nearly  million families out of poverty. And it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.\n",

      "And I agree with my friend, Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.\n",
      "This has to do with bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you very much.\n",
      "LACEY: One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it's nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.\n",
      "Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation -- and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this -- doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $ an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $, a month.\n",
      "We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And, number one, you start having trade deals, not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal.\n",
      "We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.\n",
      "But it's more than that. I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because, right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.\n",
      "So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Congressman O'Rourke, same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there.\n",
      "What they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.\n",
      "If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K through  public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country, and create more than  million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.\n",

      "BURNETT: Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top  percent now own more of this nation's wealth than the bottom  percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, \"Billionaires should not exist.\" Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?\n",
      "SANDERS: When you have a half-a-million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have  people --  million people uninsured or underinsured, when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.\n",
      "And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. And we cannot afford a billionaire class, whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for  years.\n",
      "So if you're asking me do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying -- the wealthiest, top . percent, start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that's exactly what I believe.\n",

      "STEYER: Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been  years where corporations have bought this government, and those  years have meant a -year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It's absolutely wrong. It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.\n",
      "I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.\n",
      "As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise --  percent of Americans have not had a raise for  years. If you took the minimum wage from  and just adjusted it for inflation, you get $ bucks. It's $.. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $ bucks.\n",
      "There's something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That's why I'm running for president, because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants -- health care, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage...\n",

      "Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren's wealth tax plans do that?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, look, demonizing wealth -- what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea -- we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax -- I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of . percent.\n",
      "I would double it, because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is -- like I said -- the -- a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.\n",
      "Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there's $,,,, in tax loopholes. You can't justify a minimum $ billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.\n",
      "Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to -- we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.\n",
      "And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody's right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in our employees, they're reinvesting and buying back their stock.\n",

      "Washington politicians, congressmen and senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad's Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school, I didn't know that wasn't every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It's a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.\n",
      "But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything.

      "KLOBUCHAR: It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. [laughter]\n",
      "We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer. That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.\n",
      "So we have different ways -- I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that, one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement, and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you. Senator...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: It is not one idea that rules here.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, please respond. [applause]\n",
      "WARREN: So understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.\n",
      "Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I would like to respond to that.\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator Klobuchar, respond, please.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn't have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn't have survived. If my mom didn't have unions as a teacher, she wouldn't have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced.\n",
      "So just because we have different ideas, and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on, we are in Ohio. We can win Ohio in the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don't go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him.\n",

      "Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $, a year to help close the income gap.\n",
      "HARRIS: Right.\n",
      "BURNETT: Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, here's how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She'd come home, she'd cook dinner, and at some point we'd go to bed, and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.\n",
      "And when I think about where we are right now in , I do believe justice is on the ballot. It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment, it's on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues.\n",
      "So when I think about this issue, I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table, after everyone's gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how it's going to make -- how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he's going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he's going to miss his kids' soccer games.\n",
      "That's the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I get elected and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $, a year a tax credit of up to $, a year that they can take home at up to $ a month, that's going to make a real difference in that man's life. And don't tell him that's not a big deal...\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "HARRIS: ... when he's trying to get through to the end of the month.\n",
      "BURNETT: Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?\n",
      "YANG: Senator Warren is  percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history. And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.\n",
      "If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you. Thank you.\n",
      "Congressman O'Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality? Your response.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: I think it's part of the solution. But I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.\n",
      "I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.\n",
      "And Senator Warren said show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you'll show me your values. She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $, a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.\n",

I grew up with my twin brother, Joaquin, in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother.

I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and I visited people who were homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.\n",

We literally have great generals like Mattis who said on the world stage, the United States of America, there can be no better friend than the United States of America and no better -- no greater enemy than the United States of America. This president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with Russia.\n",
      "And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.\n",
      "Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he's going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he's now given them a foothold again.\n",
      "This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he's bringing our troops home, at the same time he's increasing troop presence with the Saudis, while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen.\n",

And Erdogan understands that -- you talk about should he stay in or out of NATO -- he understands if he's out of NATO, he's in real trouble.\n",
      "But the fact of the matter is, we have been unwilling in this administration, because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election. [applause]\n",

If he is re-elected, I promise you, there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated, under -- we will be in real trouble.\n",
      "And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.\n",
      "And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. That's why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.\n",

      "Congressman O'Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia's hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Yes. We must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy and being able to do it thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.\n",
      "But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage, we do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn't enough money in this country, there aren't enough servicemembers as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.\n",
      "And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of servicemembers to fight those battles there.\n",
      "And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers, one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy and our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals not on the backs of -, and -, and -year-olds any more, but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.\n",

      "Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts? Please respond.\n",
      "STEYER: Absolutely. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump's America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners, has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it's proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.\n",
      "Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis. I've been working on it for  years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.\n",
      "So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we're going to do, but specifically climate, we're going to have to lead the world morally, we're going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially.\n",
      "This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one in every single light.\n",
      "LACEY: Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia.\n",
      "YANG: Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he's now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy.\n",
      "We have to let Russia know, look, we get it. We've tampered with other elections, you've tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this.\n",
      "But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the st century threats. Artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors, these are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology.\n",

      "And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. That's the Honest Ads Act. That's a bipartisan bill that I lead. And we can't wait...\n",

      "Congressman O'Rourke, in the last debate, you said, quote, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-, your AK-,\" but when you were asked how you'd enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don't even know who has those weapons.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Look, we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-s and AK-s.\n",
      "Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. Nine people killed in under  seconds. In El Paso, Texas,  were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.\n",
      "So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging, with  million AR-s and AK-s out there, they are also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.\n",
      "Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision surveyed them. More than  percent feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this president's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso.\n",

      "COOPER: Congressman, let me follow up. Just to follow up, your expectations aside, your website says you will fine people who don't give up their weapons. That doesn't take those weapons off the street. So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up and you don't know where they are?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: If someone does not turn in an AR- or an AK-, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, they will be other consequences from law enforcement.\n",

      "We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.\n",
      "COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, your response.\n",

I want to make sure we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war, but to use the analogy of health care, it would be as though we said, look, we're for primary care, but let's not talk about mental health care because that's a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let's save that for another day.\n",

But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who've lost a loved one to an AR-, an AK-, marched for our lives, formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians, that was a slap in the fact to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR- and an AK-.\n",

The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell's desk, the background check bill, my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don't get guns, the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That's what we should be focusing on.\n",
      "And I just don't want to screw this up. When I'm president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio, will never happen again. But let's not mess this up with this fight.\n",

We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn't register them, and a huge tax on them, and then let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people.\n",
      "But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you've rightly identified, it's not just about mass shootings. It's what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide, and it is about domestic violence.\n",
      "This is not going to be a one and done, that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we're done. We have to reduce gun violence overall. And the question we have to ask is, why hasn't it happened?\n",

      "The way to deal with those guns and those AR-s and assault weapons that are on the street -- or not on the street, that people own, is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.\n",
      "I'm the only one that got -- got -- moved the -- to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than  rounds in it. I've done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That would change it. [applause]\n",

      "Secretary Castro, the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from handguns, not assault-style weapons. What's your plan to prevent those deaths?\n",
      "CASTRO: Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn't uncommon to hear gunshots at night. And I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other.\n",
      "You know, in the neighborhoods -- let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one, folks can't define it. And if you're not going door to door, then it's not really mandatory.\n",
      "But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at : in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn't even announced himself. And within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home.\n",
      "And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that. [applause]\n",

      "LACEY: Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic, Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Brie, a teacher in Proctorville, asks, in rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has affected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily, witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember, when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it's gotten worse and worse. And we now know why.\n",
      "As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the e-mail from one of the pharma executives that actually said, \"Keep pumping them out. They're eating them like Doritos.\"\n",
      "So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That's the first way.\n",
      "And you can, with a  cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help rural areas where they're so isolated, and also in urban areas, where it's, by the way, not just opiates. There are still mental health issues and crack cocaine issues.\n",
      "This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And by his third DWI, they said to him, the prosecutor, you've got to face jail or you got to go to treatment. He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace. And he has been sober ever since. And now he's  and in assisted living, and he said to me last year, it's hard to get a drink around here, anyway. But he still has an AA group that visits him there.\n",
      "And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.\n",
      "STEYER: Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America has had, , people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that's not only a tragedy for them, it's a tragedy for their family and their communities.\n",
      "And so I think we have to treat this as a health citizens. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people.\n",
      "But I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government. And we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want.\n",
      "We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I've put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a natural referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote\n",
      "These corporations have taken over our government. And , deaths...\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "STEYER: ... last year are the tragic result.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?\n",
      "YANG: That's exactly right. And we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate.\n",
      "They ended up levying a $ million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $ billion. They got a  percent fine, and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.\n",
      "So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our community so our people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem.\n",
      "And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is, after you save someone who's OD'ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.\n",
      "So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing. This was a systemic government failing. And then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O'Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described. And also just from some personal experiences I've had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions.\n",
      "I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the V.A. Now, imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribe an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, ensured the V.A....\n",
      "YANG: Yes, preach, Beto.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: ... could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who've been arrested for possession, and make sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.\n",
      "I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, we're going to continue to have this problem going on again. So that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: They're an opportunity for our public health system in America.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Congressman. Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable. Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail?\n",
      "HARRIS: I am. And I will tell you, as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers. They have been engaged... [applause]\n",
      "And I've seen it happen before. I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I've seen what they do.\n",
      "The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $ billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.\n",
      "And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And, yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice.\n",
      "And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice, understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let's end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs, and let's go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they've been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond.\n",
      "CASTRO: Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also with criminal penalties. And, you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it's these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade-and-a-half ago.\n",

      "You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies, making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top  drug companies made $ billion in profit.\n",
      "This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it's not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.\n",

      "Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.\n",
      "It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I've done it before. I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there, and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression.\n",

      "And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don't want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong.\n",
      "If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what's broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives, things like childcare and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.\n",

      "But here's the real question I believe you should be asking is: Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like. It highlights how critical it is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who is ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.\n",
      "Bringing the experience that I have, both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee, the experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over  years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.\n",
      "I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Congresswoman.\n",
      "GABBARD: I'd like to ask our other candidates this question. I'd like to start with Senator Warren...\n",
      "BURNETT: Sorry, Congressman, I'm sorry.\n",
      "GABBARD: ... what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief.\n",
      "BURNETT: I'm sorry, thank you. We're going to take another break now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio will be back in just a few moments.\n",
      "[commercial break]\n",
      "COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. Mark Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Mark?\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?\n",
      "YANG: As usual, Senator Warren is  percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move.\n",
      "But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true.\n",
      "So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.\n",
      "Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use st century solutions for st century problems. Using a th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about  percent,  percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About  percent of all sales online happen in one place: that's Amazon.\n",
      "It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Mr. Steyer, your response?\n",
      "STEYER: Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.\n",
      "But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch -- one room, no employers -- and built a multi-billion-dollar international business. We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.\n",
      "In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan's a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he's failed the American people, and he has to go.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n",
      "Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?\n",
      "BOOKER: Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy -- we have seen it in the ' election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.\n",
      "And antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.\n",
      "And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact that we -- it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in  is Donald Trump. [applause]\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Congressman O'Rourke, you say you're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. So what's the proper level of oversight here?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Yeah, we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we, the people, have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits.\n",
      "Right now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when, in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.\n",
      "And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.\n",
      "So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy, and data, and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.\n",
      "LACEY: Senator Sanders, your response?\n",
      "SANDERS: When we talk about a rigged economy, it's not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have  media companies that control about  percent of what the American people see, hear, or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Senator Harris, to you, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?\n",
      "HARRIS: No, I don't agree with that at all. And serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that's -- that's a ridiculous argument he's making.\n",
      "But I do want to also say this. What we're talking about is a grave injustice, when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.\n",
      "And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.\n",
      "Because here we have Donald Trump, who has  million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.\n",
      "We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond.\n",
      "WARREN: So, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, join me -- join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.\n",
      "WARREN: But let's figure -- no. Let's figure out...\n",
      "HARRIS: No?\n",
      "WARREN: ... why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech -- you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.\n",
      "HARRIS: You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.\n",
      "WARREN: I announced this morning -- I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We've already agreed, Bernie and I, we're not taking any money from big pharma executives.\n",
      "You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices...\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Harris?\n",
      "WARREN: ... that support us all.\n",
      "HARRIS: You -- it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.\n",
      "WARREN: Yes.\n",
      "HARRIS: Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.\n",

      "LACEY: Your response?\n",
      "HARRIS: I'm not finished. I'm not finished.\n",

      "HARRIS: And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that.\n",
      "HARRIS: So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?\n",
      "WARREN: What I do have a problem with is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for  years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom markets. I had a life before government.\n",
      "And what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long distance market. Well, right now we have another gilded age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed.\n",
      "But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro-competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, would you like to weigh in?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: And this means everything from tech on down.\n",
      "LACEY: Please respond.\n",
      "CASTRO: Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.\n",
      "And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should, or it's a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices, and that's what I would do as president.\n",
      "LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\n",

      "YANG: The best way we can fight back -- the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Yang.\n",
      "GABBARD: There's a bigger issue here...\n",
      "BURNETT: Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they're pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them?\n",
      "HARRIS: My plan is as -- as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect. That's called pre-clearance.\n",
      "Because the reality is that while we still have -- as I said earlier -- these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence. [applause]\n",
      "But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen it. I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was, uh, uh, no.\n",
      "The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision. [applause]\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator Harris, thank you.\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say, what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew -- you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.\n",
      "That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for  years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country, when over  percent of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over  percent of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond.\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They're not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country -- liberty, the ability to control your own body -- but they're particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty, because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body.\n",
      "And so the way as president of the United States I'm going to deal with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House-level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade.\n",
      "I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment, so that we are leading the Planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?\n",
      "GABBARD: This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.\n",
      "I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as they're passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.\n",
      "I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you very much.\n",
      "The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican-appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights?\n",
      "BIDEN: I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.\n",
      "I want to point out that the justices I've supported, when I defeated Robert Bork -- and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.\n",
      "The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.\n",
      "And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that's what I would do. No one would get on the court.\n",
      "And by the way, if, in fact, at the end of this -- beginning next year, if, in fact, one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "Mayor Buttigieg, you have discussed expanding the court from  to  justices. What's your response to the vice president?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values, for example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.\n",
      "What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court. We can't go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.\n",
      "Now, one way to fix this would be to have a -member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other . Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal and how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.\n",
      "There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits -- don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else -- to a rotation off the appellate bench.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I'm not wedded to a particular solution, but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one...\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: ... that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because we can't go on like this.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro, he's talking about making the court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?\n",
      "CASTRO: I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the court. You know, I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe, if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.\n",
      "I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde amendment, because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her health care needs met.\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?\n",
      "WARREN: I think there are a number of options. I think, as Mayor Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them.\n",
      "But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.\n",
      "What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are -year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.\n",
      "BURNETT: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "WARREN: We should not leave this to the Supreme Court. We should do it through democracy, because we can.\n",
      "BURNETT: Thank you very much, Senator.\n",
      "COOPER: As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done, and if you can get it done.\n",
      "I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $ billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us -- putting us in a position where I was able to end roe -- excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons.\n",
      "And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you're going to do it, and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.\n",
      "COOPER: Just to clarify, Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, the senator said -- she's being vague on the issue of -- actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here's the deal. Come on. It costs $ trillion. Guess what? That's over $ trillion -- it's more than the entire federal budget -- let me finish, OK?\n",
      "COOPER: You'll both get in.\n",
      "BIDEN: If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you -- it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?\n",
      "SANDERS: Two things. Let me explain in two ways.\n",
      "COOPER: Senator Sanders, respond.\n",
      "SANDERS: Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us  million jobs.\n",
      "Now, let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $ billion in profit.\n",
      "COOPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "SANDERS: If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.\n",

Yes, we have to fight -- absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it's going to take more than fighting.

Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime -- Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the 's, an assault weapons ban, which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students.\n",

I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I serve.\n",

Also, teachers, as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.\n",
      "And sometimes also -- and this goes to the heart of your question, I think -- people who thought differently from me, folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there's a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.\n",
      "I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.\n",
      "I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions.\n",

We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.\n",

My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, when you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.\n",

And over  years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully, and that's why I'm running for the president, because our government has failed, it's been bought by corporations, and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people.\n",

John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was -- he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.\n",
      "And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \"John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight.\" And he'd say, \"You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve.\" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.\n",
      "And one of the things -- that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.\n",
      "Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.\n",
      "And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the st century.

      "And on the stage, you see them. They have all met the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee. At least  others have not met the threshold. So, for the first time in this primary, a single debate in a single night with all the top candidates facing off.\n",
      "It is a critical test for the candidates and their campaigns at a critical time for our country. They're going to lay out their vision for the country, their records, their differences with President Trump and each other. And we're going to do our best to bring you a lively, informative, and civil debate.\n",

Go Tigers. [applause]\n",
      "MUIR: We can feel the energy in the room, can't we, Linsey? The rules of this debate are very basic tonight and have been agreed to by all the campaigns in advance. Candidates will have one minute,  seconds to answer a direct question and  seconds for a rebuttal or response as directed by one of the moderators. Candidates will each see green and yellow lights -- there you see them right there -- indicating how much time they have remaining. And when time is up, the light will turn red.

We need a bold vision: universal pre-K and universal health care, unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy, a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.\n",

That's what Kennedy did, it's what Carter did, it's what Clinton did, it's what Barack Obama did, and it's what I can do in this race.

      "The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills, we have to be bigger. We have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That's what I want to do for you as president of the United States. Thank you. [applause]\n",

But if you're stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change. She was a church woman that said, without vision, the people will perish.\n",

      "That's the story of America. At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose.

My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $, a month for an entire year to  American families, someone watching this at home right now.

      "We keep sending politicians to Washington asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us. Good politics is supposed to be not about the day-to-day fights of the politicians, but about the day-to-day lives of Americans.\n",
      "We just marked the anniversary of /. All day today, I've been thinking about September th, the way it felt when for a moment we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people.

      "So, President Trump, you've spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we've gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over , lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.\n",
      "But here's what you don't get: What you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this. And we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we're registered to vote. And I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America.\n",

      "But we must do more. We must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. And as president, I am prepared to take them on.\n",
      "Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has health care as a human right, not a privilege.

      "BIDEN: You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said, we're doing it because we refuse to postpone. Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases which, if we invest in them, we can find cures.\n",
      "I refuse to postpone giving single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change.\n",
      "Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single solitary time when we've set our mind to something we've been unable to do it. We're walking around with our heads down like woe is me. We're the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates, thank you. Several of you said you are more united than divided, and that is certainly true. All of you agree on one big thing, the goal of defeating President Trump, driving the country in a new direction. But out on the campaign trail, you have outlined big differences over how far to go and how fast to go.\n",
      "And, Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate. Both senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for All. You want to build on Obamacare, not scrap it. They propose spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt. And they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs.\n",
      "Are senators Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go and where the country needs to go?\n",
      "BIDEN: That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I think -- I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.\n",
      "Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $ billion. It doesn't cost $ trillion, $. trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. That's before -- exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear that tonight how that's happened.\n",
      "Thus far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. And the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. There's a lot of other things that need to be done.\n",
      "I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at-risk schools that are Title I schools, from  to $ billion a year. But I go down the line and these are things we're talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it's better.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, let me take that to you, particularly on what Senator Biden was saying there about health care. He has actually praised Bernie Sanders for being candid about his health care plan, that Senator -- says that Sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated. Will you make that same admission?\n",
      "WARREN: So, let's be clear about health care. And let's actually start where vice president did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being. [applause]\n",
      "And now the question is, how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle class families are going to pay less. That's how this is going to work. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Direct question. You said middle class families are going to pay less. But will middle class taxes go up to pail for pay for the program? I know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down. Will middle class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?\n",
      "WARREN: Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost. That's what they have to deal with. And understand, families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network, sorry, we are not covering that prescription.\n",
      "Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it. They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the co-pay. What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets, what's going to happen in their budgets.\n",
      "And the answer is on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, you were invoked by the vice president, also take on that question about taxes.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $ trillion.\n",
      "That's right, Joe.\n",
      "Status quo over  years will be $ trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so...[applause]...intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. Nobody in America will pay more than $ a year for prescription drugs, because we're going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry. [applause]\n",
      "We need -- we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $ billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies.\n",
      "And I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for All is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice president Biden...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: If I could respond, George.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: You get a response and then we're going to broaden out the discussion.\n",
      "BIDEN: OK, number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the costs of -- the largest out-of-pocket payment you'll pay is $,. You'll be able to get into a -- anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, et cetera.\n",
      "But guess what? Of the  million people who like their health care now, they can keep it. If they don't like it, they can leave. Number one.\n",
      "Number two, the fact of the matter is, we're in a situation where, if you notice, he hasn't answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Let's have a big idea. The tax of  percent that the senator is talking about, that raises about $ billion. Guess what? That leaves you $ billion short.\n",
      "The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your pay -- there will be a deductible, in your paycheck. You're going to -- the middle class person, someone making  grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $, more. They're going to end up paying  percent more on their income tax. That's a reality. Now, it's not a bad idea if you like it. I don't like it.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, now I want everybody to keep to the time, but you did invoke both senators. I have to get responses from them...\n",
      "BIDEN: Sure, no, that's good.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: ... and then we will broaden it out.\n",
      "Senator Warren, you go first.\n",
      "WARREN: So, let's be clear, I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. [applause]\n",
      "I've met people who like their doctors. I've met people who like their nurses. I've met people who like their pharmacists. I've met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care. And we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about.\n",
      "Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we're going to do this by saying, everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every health care provider is covered. And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill?\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders.\n",
      "SANDERS: Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.\n",
      "BIDEN: This is America.\n",
      "SANDERS: Yes, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries. And they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for All proposal, when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums, maybe you've run into people who love their premiums, I haven't.\n",
      "What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar, you said in your opening statement you don't -- you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes. Who represents the extreme on this stage?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals up here, George, so I'm talking about...\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Which ones?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: If I could -- if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends. First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada.\n",
      "We have worked to bring down the cost by fighting to allow  million seniors, that's a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figure that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.\n",
      "But when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor's creed, which is, do no harm. And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. And on page eight -- on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that  million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.\n",
      "That's in four years. I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea. And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning. And that is a public option. A non-profit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover  million more people, and bring down the prices for  million more people. That is a bold idea. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, page eight of the bill, she says,  people will lose their health insurance.\n",
      "WARREN: I'm sorry.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: She said, page eight of the bill,  million people will lose their health insurance.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Current health insurance.\n",
      "BIDEN: One hundred forty-nine million.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Million, excuse me.\n",
      "WARREN: So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles.\n",
      "What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $ billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $ billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway.\n",
      "Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we're right, as progressives, that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you?\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders,  seconds.\n",
      "SANDERS: George, you talked about, was it  million people on private insurance? Fifty million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for All is comprehensive health care. Covers all basic needs, including home health care.\n",
      "It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So, if you want comprehensive health care, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $ a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is the way to go.

      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Harris, you startled out co-sponsoring Senator Sanders's bill, you now say you're uncomfortable with it. Why?\n",
      "HARRIS: I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.\n",
      "I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far on Medicare for All. I support Medicare for All, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did.\n",
      "Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them.\n",
      "So, under my Medicare for all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that's what people want. And I agree, we shouldn't take choice from people.\n",
      "But here's the thing. Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now  million Americans don't have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.\n",
      "So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We all fought against it. And then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about  o'clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country. [applause]\n",
      "Fast forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of  can no longer be on our plans.\n",
      "And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they're going to have health care and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let's focus on the end goal. If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.\n",
      "BIDEN: George,  seconds? Fifteen seconds? [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me get to Congressman O'Rourke and then bring you -- go ahead, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: Fifteen seconds. Look, everybody says we want an option. The option I'm proposing is Medicare for all -- Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance -- from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don't have -- no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.\n",
      "And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings, the president thinks -- my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer's going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They're going to give back that money to the employee?\n",
      "SANDERS: As a matter of fact, they will in our bill.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, let me tell you something. For a socialist, you've got -- for a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders?\n",
      "SANDERS: OK, one minute, George?\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Go ahead.\n",
      "SANDERS: All right. Two points. You got to defend the fact that today not only do we have  million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that , Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they're going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease -- cancer or heart disease.\n",
      "Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer. And our program is the only one that does that.\n",
      "BIDEN: I know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something. It's personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.\n",
      "And we're talking four, six, eight, ten years, depending on who you talk about, before we get to Medicare for all. Come on. I've been there. You've been there. You know what it's like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman O'Rourke?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now.\n",
      "But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions uninsured and uncared for.\n",
      "In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better. In my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who's insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare. And those, like members of unions who've fought for the health care plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them. This is the best possible path forward.\n",
      "BIDEN: You just described my plan.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: This is -- health care is the top issue for everyone in the country. I want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond. So, Secretary Castr, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you will get a minute.\n",
      "CASTRO: Thank you. And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this. And, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves  million people uncovered.\n",
      "Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn't true, when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that, and they said that was true.\n",
      "You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type  diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse. But that whole time, she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available.\n",
      "If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do. But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn't have a buy in.\n",
      "That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave  million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.\n",
      "BIDEN: They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.\n",
      "CASTRO: You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.\n",
      "BIDEN: Do not have to buy in if you can't afford it.\n",
      "CASTRO: You said they would have to buy in.\n",
      "BIDEN: Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled.\n",
      "CASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.\n",
      "BIDEN: I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money.\n",
      "CASTRO: I mean, look, look, we need a health care system...\n",
      "BIDEN: She -- you're automatically enrolled.\n",
      "CASTRO: It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.\n",
      "BIDEN: That'll be a surprise to him.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Andrew Yang?\n",
      "YANG: Come on, guys.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yeah.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that -- my plan, your plan. Look, we all have different visions for what is better...\n",
      "CASTRO: Yeah, that's called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That's called an election. [applause]\n",
      "That's an election. You know? This is what we're here for. It's an election.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Yes, but a house -- a house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we're going to win this. [applause]\n",
      "YANG: Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team here. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.\n",
      "And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend their contractors. It's harder to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business.\n",
      "The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Booker...\n",
      "YANG: Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the health care system.\n",
      "And the Cleveland Clinic, where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe -- shocker -- they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Booker, close out this discussion.\n",
      "BOOKER: Thank you very much. Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis. They don't have health insurance. Their health insurance doesn't go far enough. They can't afford their prescription drugs.\n",
      "Look, I'm clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare for all. I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system. But dear God, I know every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions.\n",
      "And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now. They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now.\n",
      "And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. [applause]\n",
      "And we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans. But every single day, I'll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates, thank you. Linsey Davis?\n",
      "DAVIS: Thanks, George. Since we're here at an HBCU, I'd like to start with young black voters. Several recent polls indicate their number-one concern is racism. This campus, this state, and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on Latinos in El Paso.\n",
      "Now, we know that the racial divide started long before President Trump and President Obama, but each of you on this stage has said that President Trump has made that divide worse. Congressman O'Rourke, coming to you first, why are you the most qualified candidate to address this divide?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: You know, I called this out in no uncertain terms on August rd and every day since then. And I was talking about it long before then, as well.\n",
      "Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, , but August , , when the first kidnapped African...[applause]...was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy.\n",
      "We have to be able to answer this challenge. And it is found in our education system, where in Texas, a -year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin. [applause]\n",
      "In our health care system, where there's a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there's  times the wealth in white America than there is in black America.\n",
      "I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundation. [applause]\n",
      "But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country. [applause]\n",
      "DAVIS: Secretary Castro,  seconds to respond.\n",
      "CASTRO: Look, you know, I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. He's done a great job with that.\n",
      "Look, a few weeks ago, a shooter drove  miles inspired by this --  hours inspired by this president to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out.\n",
      "I'm proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. I'm also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we're not going to have any more Laquan McDonalds or Eric Garners or Michael Browns or Pamela Turners or Walter Scotts or Sandra Bland, here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Booker, you have said, quote, \"The real question isn't who is or isn't a racist. It's who is going to do something about it.\" Senator, what do you plan to do about it?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists. The question isn't who isn't a racist. It's who is and isn't doing something about racism.\n",
      "And this is not just an issue that started yesterday. It's not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system. And it's nice to go all the way back to slavery, but dear God, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in .\n",
      "We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out, and having a plan to do something about it. If I am president of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes. [applause]\n",
      "And we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans, from criminal justice reform to the disparities in health care to even one that we don't talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country. [applause]\n",
      "DAVIS: Mayor Buttigieg, you've been struggling with issues around race in your own community. You've also said that anyone who votes to re-elect President Trump is, at best, looking the other way on racism. Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I believe what's deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a chance to change all of that.\n",
      "Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us. That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It's -- it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms compound. In the same way that a dollar saved compounds, so does a dollar stolen.\n",
      "And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.\n",
      "I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that we're not only dealing with things like the overincarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to  percent...[applause]...the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses, investing in HBCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs. [applause]\n",
      "We can and must do that. But that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker. Because when I -- where I come from, a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three. We've got to say that...[applause]...and bring people together.\n",
      "DAVIS: Also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform.\n",
      "Senator Harris, you released your plan for that just this week. And it does contradict some of your prior positions. Among them, you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don't. You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don't. You've said that you changed on these and other things because you were, quote, \"swimming against the current, and thankfully the currents have changed.\"\n",
      "But when you had the power, why didn't you try to effect change then? [applause]\n",
      "HARRIS: So, there have been -- there have been -- I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record.\n",
      "Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe. And second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias. And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that, if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside.\n",
      "And so I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs.\n",
      "I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.\n",
      "I created one of the first in the nation trainings for a police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.\n",
      "Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. [applause]\n",
      "It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable.\n",
      "And finally, my plan is about making sure that, in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact.\n",
      "And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Senator Harris. [applause]\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar, during your eight years as a prosecutor in Minnesota, there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police. Critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases.\n",
      "The ACLU's legal director in Minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice. Do you wish now that you had done more?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: That's not my record.\n",
      "UNKNOWN: [inaudible]\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: We are here at a historically black college. And I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said. She said, \"What the people want is simple; they want a country as good as its promise.\"\n",
      "And that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis.\n",
      "But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury. That's how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself.\n",
      "That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did,  people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids.\n",
      "There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it. When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups; we put up billboards; we found the shooter and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.\n",
      "What changes did we make? Go after white-collar crimes in a big way, diversity the office in a big way, work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID.\n",
      "And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the  percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison. [applause]\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n",
      "You all believe that the war on drugs has put too many Americans behind bars.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison. Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough. Your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, first of all, let me say that, when I came back from law school, I had a job with a great -- a big-time law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated. We were occupied by the National Guard for  months.\n",
      "I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman -- as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate, et cetera.\n",
      "The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation.\n",
      "Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As -- when we were in the White House, we released , people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. [applause]\n",
      "We -- I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them that when they get out -- nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released -- they shouldn't be in there; that should be a misdemeanor. They should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned.\n",
      "When you finish your term in prison, you should be able not only to vote but have access to Pell grants, have access to be able to get housing...[applause]...have access to be able to move along the way. I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines. And the fact is, we've learned so much more more...\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: Thank you.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Booker,  seconds to respond.\n",
      "BOOKER: Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs. But if you are African-American, you are almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives.\n",
      "And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson says treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.\n",
      "And so I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstrably now show that there are , people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say, when we are president of the United States; when I am president of the United States, we will release them.\n",
      "And let me be specific. I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail.\n",
      "If  members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long, and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now.\n",
      "Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these , people. And I challenge you. Don't just say a big statement; back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long.\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Senator Booker. [applause]\n",
      "David?\n",
      "MUIR: Thank you, Linsey.\n",
      "I want to turn to the deadly mass shootings here in this country. And of course we are all mindful tonight of where we stand. We are here in Texas tonight, where  people have lost their lives in just the last month alone, El Paso, which we've discussed; in Odessa. And I know there are survivors from El Paso right here in the hall tonight.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you, because we all remember Sandy Hook. Twenty-six people died in that school,  of them children. Those first graders would be in eighth grade today.\n",
      "MUIR: At the time, there was a groundswell in this country to get something done. President Obama asked you to lead the push for gun control.\n",
      "You have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, but four months after Sandy Hook, a measure to require expanded background checks died on the Senate floor.\n",
      "If you couldn't get it done after Sandy Hook, why should voters give you another chance?\n",
      "BIDEN: Because I got it done before. I'm the only one up here that's ever beat the NRA --only one ever to beat the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that brought the Brady bill into -- into focus and became law.\n",
      "And so that's number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook, a number of things happened. It went from a cause to a movement. Look what's happened now. Mothers -- the organization -- mothers against violence -- gun violence. We've seen what's happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change.\n",
      "There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over  percent of gun -- of gun -- of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct.\n",
      "Over  percent of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street -- period. And we have to get buy-backs and get them out of their basements. [applause]\n",
      "So the point is, things have changed. And things have changed a lot. And now what's happening is -- and, by the way, the way Beto handled -- excuse me for saying Beto. What the congressman...\n",

They said 'I'm going to issue an executive order.'\" Biden saying, \"There's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say 'I'm going to eliminate assault weapons,'\" saying, \"you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order.\"\n",

I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.\n",
      "And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing, to act, is just -- it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.\n",
      "I was talking about this at one of my town halls, and -- and this child who was eight years old, probably, came up to me -- it was like it was a secret between the two of us, and he tugged on my jacket and he said, \"I had to have one of those drills.\"\n",

      "You've gone further. You've said, quote, \"Americans who own AR-s and AK-s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.\" You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?\n",

The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-s and AK-s and those who were buying those weapons. And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there, folks who said, I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: I so appreciate what the congressman's been doing. And I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.\n",
      "Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store, where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage. And certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in  seconds, one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute, and it still wasn't enough to save those people. That's what unites us.\n",
      "You know what else unites us? And I'll tell you this. What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell's desk, are three bills -- universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-s. [applause]\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Klobuchar?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: So if we want to get something done -- and I personally think we should start with a voluntary buyback program. That's what I think, David. But I want to finish this, because if you want action now, if you want action now, we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We can't wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done.\n",

      "I want to turn to Senator Booker, because you have said just this week about guns and about the candidates on this stage, that the differences do matter. Those were your words.\n",
      "You have argued, if you need a license to drive a car in this country, you should have a license to buy a gun. Gun-owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun. This would require, as you know, Congress to pass legislation.\n",
      "If Democrats can't get universal background checks, how would you get this done? And can you name one Republican colleague of yours in the Senate right now who would be onboard with this idea?\n",
      "BOOKER: So, background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans. Eighty-three percent of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue.\n",
      "Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about  years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing.\n",
      "But this is what I'm sorry about. I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.\n",
      "You want to know how we get this done? We get this done by having a more courageous empathy, where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities. They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n",
      "I will lead change on this issue, because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget, national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before. [applause]\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Booker, thank you. A quick follow-up, though, because Americans watching tonight know the reality of Congress in Washington. I asked do you have a Republican colleague in the Senate who would be onboard with this idea to get this done?\n",
      "BOOKER: You know, if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement. The number-one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry.\n",
      "Think about this. We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined, from the Revolutionary War until now. This is not a side issue to me. It is a central issue to me.\n",
      "That is the kind of fight -- because the majority of homicide victims -- we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine. We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency. Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun-owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it. [applause]\n",
      "BIDEN: Go beat them.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Booker, thank you. Senator Warren, I want to come to you next, because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with Republicans in the Senate. What can you get done on gun control?\n",
      "WARREN: So let's start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country.\n",
      "And we agree on many steps we could take to fix it. My view on this is, we're going to -- it's not going to be one and done on this. We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly.\n",
      "But here's the deal. The question we need to ask is, when we've got this much support across the country,  percent of Americans want to see us do -- I like registration -- want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets, why doesn't it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple. [applause]\n",
      "We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry. And unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when  senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with  senators, it failed because of the filibuster.\n",
      "Until we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country. We've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people. [applause]\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Warren, thank you. You bring up eliminating the filibuster, which means you would need simply a simple majority in a Republican Senate to get something done. I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this, because you've said before of this, if Donald Trump supports ending the filibuster, which he's talked about himself, you should be nervous. Would you support ending the filibuster?\n",
      "SANDERS: No. But what I would support, absolutely, is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about, Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for  votes to make that happen, and you can do it in a variety of ways. You can do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is in order and what is not.\n",
      "But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system, and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or, in this case, you've got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership. [applause]\n",
      "I am proud -- I am proud that, year after year, I had an \"F\" rating from the NRA. And as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.\n",

      "RAMOS: We've been hearing a lot about what's been happening here in Texas. Only a few weeks ago, the deadliest massacre of Latinos, Latinos, in modern U.S. history happened in this state, in El Paso. So the fear among Latinos -- and you know this -- is very real.\n",
      "So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country: immigration. Vice President Biden, as a presidential candidate, in , you supported the border wall, saying, \"Unlike most Democrats, I voted for  miles of fence.\" This is what you said.\n",
      "Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported  million people, the most ever in U.S. history. Did you do anything to prevent those deportations? I mean, you've been asked this question before and refused to answer, so let me try once again. Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations? Why should Latinos trust you?\n",
      "BIDEN: What Latinos should look at is -- comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one. We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things, number one.\n",
      "Number two -- number two, by the time -- this is a president who came along with the DACA program. No one had ever done that before. This is the president that sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the  million undocumented in the United States of America. This is a president who's done a great deal. So I'm proud to have served with him.\n",
      "What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed. I would, in fact, make sure that there is -- we immediately surge to the border. All those people who are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation who says, if you want to flee, and you're freeing oppression, you should come.\n",
      "I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.\n",
      "And by the way, retrospectively, you know, the th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Let's put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act. Now [inaudible] back...\n",
      "RAMOS: Yeah, but you didn't answer the question.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, I did answer the question.\n",
      "RAMOS: No, did you make a mistake with those deportations?\n",
      "BIDEN: The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.\n",

      "BIDEN: I'm the vice president of the United States.\n",
      "RAMOS: Secretary Castro, would you want to respond to Vice President Biden?\n",
      "CASTRO: I mean, look...\n",
      "RAMOS: And let me put this in context, because your party controlled the White House and Congress in  and didn't pass immigration reform, and this broke a promise made by President Barack Obama to Latinos. So why should voters trust Democrats now? I mean, now it is even more difficult, as you know, because you need Republican votes in the Senate. So are you willing, for instance, to give up DACA or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize . million undocumented immigrants?\n",
      "CASTRO: Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And, look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that's very different from Barack Obama.\n",
      "But my problem with Vice President Biden -- and Cory pointed this out last time -- is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too, and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, well, that was the president. I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions. I mean... [applause]\n",
      "RAMOS: Vice President Biden, you have -- you have  seconds.\n",

      "CASTRO: Let me just say...\n",
      "BIDEN: That's not what I said.\n",
      "CASTRO: Jorge, let me just say that I would -- I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because I'm not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. I'm not going to back pedal. I'm not going to pretend like I don't have my own vision for immigration.\n",
      "So we're not going to give up DACA. We're not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January , , we're going to have a Democratic president, we're going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House, and we're going to pass immigration reform within the first  days.\n",
      "RAMOS: Vice President,  seconds.\n",

      "You want ICE, the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants.\n",
      "So how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrive legally but overstay their visas? And how would you stop hundreds of thousands of Central Americans who want to migrate to the U.S.?\n",

      "I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our DREAMers, but also for their grandparents, and for their cousins, for people who have overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable.\n",
      "Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a -year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer, and it is not serving our values. [applause]\n",
      "RAMOS: Mr. Yang...\n",
      "WARREN: We need -- I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering. [applause]\n",
      "We need to restore that help. We need to help establish and re-establish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives. We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically. We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back. [applause]\n",
      "RAMOS: Mr. Yang? It is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe anti-immigrant measures, from putting kids in cages to limiting asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence. But it is also true about  million immigrants enter the U.S. legally every year. So, are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from  million to  million per year? And should there be a merit system, as President Trump wants?\n",

      "If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune  companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants. And rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism, and I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration.\n",
      "I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says, build a wall. I'm going to say to immigrants, come to America, because if you come here, your son our daughter can run for president. The water is great. And this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.\n",

President Trump has called Mexican immigrants rapists and killers, tried to ban Muslims from entering the country separated children from their parents.\n",

      "The only people, though, who actually buy into this president's hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don't know any. We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went into ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him.\n",
      "In some of the most conservative, rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow. And that's why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city.\n",
      "You know, the only reason that South Bend is growing right now, after years of shrinking, is immigration. It's one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington, to create city-issued municipal IDs, so that people, regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.\n",
      "We have an opportunity to actually get something done. But we cannot allow this continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values. Values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws.\n",

The U.S. relationship with China, trade, and President Trump's tariffs. We received more than  questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs.\n",
      "And, Mr. Yang, let me begin with you. Would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office? And if so, would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with China?\n",
      "YANG: I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal, because right now, the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.\n",
      "A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said, one, how can my workers compete against that? And, two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.\n",
      "So, the imbalances are real. But we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides.\n",
      "So, no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Pete, let me take that question -- let me take that question to you, because you've seen President Trump's tweets. He says what's going to happen here is the Chinese are just going to wait him out so that they can get a Democrat who they can take advantage of.\n",
      "How do you think about China? We've seen President Trump call President Xi both an enemy and a friend.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Well, the president clearly has no strategy.\n",
      "You know, when I first got into this race, I remember President Trump scoffed and said he'd like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping. I'd like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping. [laughter]\n",
      "Is it just me, or was that supposed to happen in, like, April? It's one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage, people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans. And when that happens, there are serious consequences.\n",
      "We saw it at the G. The leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been.\n",
      "The problem is, this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever, whether it's in Hong Kong, where those protesters for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States, or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America, but it can't be just any America.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you repeal the tariffs?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but it's not about the tariffs. Look, what's going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else and there's a lack of a bigger strategy.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar, you've actually supported the tariffs on steel.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: What we've got right now, though, George, it's not a focused tariff on steel. What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies. He has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country.\n",
      "One forecast recently says that it has already cost us , jobs, all right? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest, in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa.\n",
      "So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table -- that's what I would do. I wouldn't have put all these tariffs in place. And I wouldn't have had a trade policy where on August st he announces he's going to have tariffs on $ billion of goods, on August th, he cuts it in half, a week later, he says he's going to reduce taxes, the day after that, he says he's going to do it.\n",
      "The leaders of the world are watching this, and it undermines our strength as a nation. And, yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world. And he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement, like we've done in northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting President Obama to do more on that, so that our workers can benefit, so we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it's a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things, and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Secretary Castro, you actually, in one of the previous debates, identified China as the most serious national security threat to our country. I want to pick up on what Senator Klobuchar was saying. She said she would go back to the negotiating table. The question is, what do you do for leverage? Where do you get it?\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Senator Klobuchar said, , American jobs. It's estimated that it's cost $ to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago,  percent of Americans said that they believe that we're in for a recession next year.\n",
      "So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe, though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights.\n",
      "We have millions of Uighurs, for instance, in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated. [applause]\n",
      "And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that. We need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights. When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, let me bring you in on this conversation. President Obama signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In part, it was designed to rein in China, to bring China into some kind of regulation. What do you think he got wrong?\n",
      "WARREN: So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades, and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else. These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, they'll do it in a heartbeat.\n",
      "And yet for decades now, who's been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators? Who has shaped our trade policy? It's been the giant corporations. It's been their lobbyists and their executives.\n",
      "The way we change our trade policy in America is, first, the procedures. Who sits at the table? I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table. I want to negotiate it with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table.\n",
      "And you asked the question about leverage. If I can just respond to that one, the leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, you want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then you got to raise your standards. You've got to raise your labor standards. You've got to raise your environmental standards...[applause]...so our companies can compete on a level playing field. We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Harris, how would your trade policy differ from President Obama's?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, first of all, I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is we've got a guy in the White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soybeans rotting in bins, looking at bankruptcy.\n",
      "When we look at this issue, my trade policy, under a Harris administration, is always going to be about saying, we need to export American products, not American jobs. And to do that, we have to have a meaningful trade policy.\n",
      "I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff. And that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen.\n",
      "You asked earlier about China. It's a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable.\n",
      "We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on -- and I think the only person on this stage -- the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea.\n",
      "But the bottom line is this. Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in \"The Wizard of Oz,\" you know, when you pull back the curtain, it's a really small dude? [laughter]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: OK. I'm not even going to take the bait, Senator Harris. But I am going to take...\n",
      "HARRIS: Oh, George, it wasn't about you.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders right now.\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, there is a reason -- there is a reason why, in the last  years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made  years ago. And one of the reasons is that, for decades, we have had disastrous trade policies.\n",
      "I got to say to my good friend, Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over  million good-paying jobs. [applause]\n",
      "And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making  percent of what they made in manufacturing.\n",
      "So Trump, obviously, hasn't a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at  o'clock in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere, who are losing billions right now because of Trump's policy, a trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad, and then thinks they're going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Biden, he invoked your name.\n",
      "BIDEN: Yeah, well, look, we're either going to make policy or China's going to make the rules of the road. We make up  percent of the world economy. We need another  percent to join us.\n",
      "And I think Elizabeth -- Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor and at the table have to be environmentalists. The fact of the matter is, China -- the problem isn't the trade deficit, the problem is they're stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they're violating the WTO. They're dumping steel on us. That's a different issue than whether or not they're dumping agricultural products on us.\n",
      "In addition to that, we're in a position where, if we don't set the rules, we, in fact, are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that's why you need to organize the world to take on China, to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Booker, close out this round.\n",
      "BOOKER: Sure. There's one point we're really missing on the stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trump's America first policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy.\n",
      "BIDEN: Exactly right.\n",
      "BOOKER: From trade to battling China to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East, he is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris climate accords.\n",
      "And on trade, he's deciding to take on China, while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies. You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now, look, I'm the only person on this stage that finds Trudeau's hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat. [laughter]\n",
      "We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators, like Duterte and Putin, than he does with Merkel and Macron. We are the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. That's how we beat China. That's how we beat climate change on the planet Earth, and that's how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workers' rights. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: David?\n",
      "MUIR: George, thank you. I want to turn now to our troops overseas and to America's longest war in Afghanistan. U.S. talks with the Taliban are dead, according to the president. Secret talks at Camp David have been canceled before they could happen. Many of you have weighed in on that already, so I want to move past that tonight to what all of you have promised on the campaign trail.\n",
      "Many of you on this stage have said you'd bring the troops home in your first term. Others have said in your first year. Senator Warren, we all know the presidency is much different from the campaign trail. President Obama wanted to bring the troops home. President Trump promised to bring the troops home. And you have said of Afghanistan, let's help them reach a peace settlement. It is time to bring our troops home, in your words, starting right now. Would you keep that promise to bring the troops home starting right now with no deal with the Taliban?\n",
      "WARREN: Yes. And I'll tell you why. What we're doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States. It is not helping the safety and security of the world. It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home.\n",
      "And then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily. [applause]\n",
      "We're not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem, and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism.\n",
      "It means using all of our tools. It means economic investment. It means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the State Department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, a quick follow on that, because top U.S. leaders, military leaders on the ground in Afghanistan told me you can't do it without a deal with the Taliban. You just said you would, you would bring them home. What if they told you that? Would you listen to their advice?\n",
      "WARREN: I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer. I think it may have been Senator McCain's last trip before he was sick. And I talked to people -- we did -- we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders, we talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: Show me what winning looks like. Tell me what it looks like.\n",
      "And what you hear is a lot of, \"Uh,\" because no one can describe it. And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.\n",
      "I have three older brothers who all served in the military. I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do. But we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve.\n",
      "We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools. We need to build with our allies. And we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Warren, thank you. [applause]\n",
      "I do want to stay on this, and I want to turn to Mayor Buttigieg , because you're the only veteran on this stage. You served in Afghanistan. We heard in recent days from General Joseph Dunford, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said in recent days, \"I'm not going to use the word withdrawal right now. It's our judgment the Afghans need support to deal with the level of violence.\" If he's not even using the word withdrawal, would you put your promise to bring troops home in the first year on hold to follow the advice?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: You know, I served under General Dunford, way under General Dunford, in Afghanistan. [laughter]\n",
      "And today, September , , means that today you could be  years old, old enough to serve, and had not been alive on /. We have got to put an end to endless war.\n",
      "And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland, and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops.\n",
      "Let me say something else, because if there's one thing we've learned about Afghanistan, from Afghanistan, it's that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place. [applause]\n",
      "And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there. [applause]\n",
      "By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment. We saw what's going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels?\n",
      "I'll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind, the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you are responsible for in uniform, is do not let these men and women down. This president is doing exactly that. I will not. [applause]\n",
      "MUIR: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you.\n",
      "I want to turn to Vice President Biden, because the concerns about any possible vacuum being created in Afghanistan, if you pulled the U.S. troops out, has been heightened by what we've seen in recent days on the ground in Iraq.\n",
      "When you were vice president, President Obama turned to you to bring the troops home from Iraq. You have said on the campaign trail, quote, \"I made sure the president turned to me and said, Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.\" There was a major drawdown of U.S. troops, and then ISIS seized by some estimates  percent of the territory in Iraq. You then had to send thousands of troops back in. Was it wrong to pull out of Iraq that quickly? And did the move actually help ISIS take hold?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, it wasn't wrong to pull out. But I want to answer your Afghanistan question. I've been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service. But I've been out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this -- and it's an open secret, you reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan.\n",
      "The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counterinsurgency, meaning that we're going to put that country together. It cannot be put together. Let me say it again. It will not be put together. It's three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties -- the three provinces in the east. They're not any part of -- the Haqqanis run it. I will go on and on.\n",
      "But here's the point. The point is that it's a counterterrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases -- insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to air lift from and to move against what we know.\n",
      "We don't need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford's a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we've had for eight years.\n",
      "With regard to -- with regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that, you know, I should have never voted to give Bush the authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the Security Council to vote - to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof.\n",
      "I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said -- from that point on -- what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that in fact we were doing it the wrong way; there was no plan; we should not be engaged; we didn't have the people with us; we didn't have our -- we didn't have allies with us, et cetera.\n",
      "And it was later, when we came into office, that Barack turned -- the president turned to me and said, \"Joe\" -- when they said we've got a plan to get out, he turned to the whole security and said, \"Joe will organize this. Get the troops home.\"\n",
      "My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand. It made -- and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from coming -- from moving in.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Vice President, thank you.\n",
      "I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this. Because the concern over Afghanistan is very similar to what we saw in Iraq when the troops came out. ISIS filled that vacuum.\n",
      "What do you make of people out there who are worried that if we pull out U.S. troops too quickly from Afghanistan, it will create safe haven all over again, like the plotters of /?\n",
      "SANDERS: David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said.\n",
      "You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq... [applause]\n",
      "BIDEN: You're right.\n",
      "SANDERS: I voted against the war in Iraq...[applause]...and helped lead the opposition. And it's sad to say -- I mean, I, kind of, you know, had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war.\n",
      "As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said. We cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend them -- defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think, also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trump's military budgets. [applause]\n",
      "I don't think we have to spend $ billion a year on the military when we don't even know who our enemy is. [applause]\n",
      "I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together -- bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism. And make it clear that we as a planet, as a global community, will work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bomb on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it.\n",
      "MUIR: Senator Sanders, thank you. [applause]\n",
      "I want to take this to Mr. Yang. You share the stage, as you know, when when we talk about troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the vice president, who was in the Situation Room, with senators who were on the Senate Armed Services, the Foreign Relations Committees, with an Afghanistan veteran who is on the stage tonight.\n",
      "As you share the stage with these candidates, what makes you the most qualified on this stage to be commander in chief?\n",
      "YANG: I've signed a pledge to end the forever wars. We've been in a state of continuous armed conflict for  years, which is not what the American people want. We have to start owning what we can and can't do. We're not very good at rebuilding countries.\n",
      "And if you want proof, all you have to do is look within our own country of Puerto Rico. [applause]\n",
      "We've spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives -- and thank you, Pete, for your service. And the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades.\n",
      "I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment. What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harm's way. And that's what I would do as president.\n",
      "MUIR: Mr. Yang, thank you. [applause]\n",
      "Jorge?\n",
      "RAMOS: Thank you very much.\n",
      "[speaking Spanish]\n",
      "You haven't been asked about Latin America in the previous debates, so let's begin. Senator Sanders, one country where many immigrants are arriving from is Venezuela. A recent U.N. fact-finding mission found that thousands have been disappeared, tortured and killed by government forces in Venezuela.\n",
      "You admit that Venezuela does not have free elections, but still you refuse to call Nicolas Maduro a dictator -- a dictator. Can you explain why?\n",
      "And what are the main differences between your kind of socialism and the one being imposed in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua?\n",
      "SANDERS: Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make -- can create their own future.\n",
      "In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe is extremely unfair. I'll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right. [applause]\n",
      "I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave. [applause]\n",
      "I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage and that we expand the trade union movement. [applause]\n",
      "I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge -- it's not in the media and not in Congress. You've got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You've got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies and in the media.\n",
      "Maybe, just maybe, what we should be doing is creating an economy...\n",
      "RAMOS: Thank you.\n",
      "SANDERS: ... that works for all of us, not  percent. That's my understanding of democratic socialism. [applause]\n",
      "RAMOS: Secretary, you wanted to say a quick response --  seconds?\n",
      "CASTRO: Sure, thank you, Jorge. I'll call Maduro a dictator, because he is a dictator. [applause]\n",
      "And what we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that they'll have free and fair elections, and also, here in the United States, offer temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans. [applause]\n",
      "That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do. For all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community, he has failed. I will not.\n",
      "I also believe that we need to do things like a st century Marshall plan for Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala...[applause]...so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And under my administration, we're going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. They're our neighbors and we have a lot of things in common. It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately.\n",
      "RAMOS: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "CASTRO: And I will\n",
      "RAMOS: Senator Booker, let me ask you about Brazil. After the recent fires in the Amazon, some experts suggested that eating less meat is one way to help the environment. You are a vegan since . That's obviously a personal choice, but President Trump and Brazil's President Bolsonaro are concerned that climate change regulations could affect economic growth.\n",
      "So should more Americans, including those here in Texas, and in Iowa...[laughter]...follow your diet? [laughter]\n",
      "BOOKER: Um, you know, first of all, I want to say no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish. No. [laughter and applause]\n",
      "Look, on -- let's just be clear. The factory farming going on that's assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agricultural industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment. And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that don't line up with our values. That's what I'm calling for. [applause]\n",
      "But I want to -- I want to switch, because we don't have -- a crowded debate stage, we were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq. It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didn't say one word about veterans in our country. [applause]\n",
      "We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts and harms. They're disproportionately homeless. You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA. It is very important that, as we -- as a country, understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism, that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us.\n",

That we invest here in Houston, Texas, with pre-disaster mitigation grants to protect those communities that are vulnerable to flooding given the fact that this town has seen three -year floods in just five years, you'd like to think you're good for , years, but you're not. They're coming faster and larger and more devastating than ever.\n",
      "We're also going to make sure that we free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and embrace renewable wind and solar energy technology, as well as the high-paying, high-skill, high-wage jobs that come along with that. And that we're going to pay farmers for the environmental services they want to provide. Planting cover crops, keeping more land under conservation, using no-till farming, regenerative agriculture can pull carbon out of the air and can drive it and sequester it into the soil.\n",
      "That's the way that we're going to meet this challenge and we're going to bring everyone into the solution.\n",

      "This is the existential crisis of our time. It's -- you know that movie \"The Day after Tomorrow\"? It's today. We have seen a warming in our world like never before. We're seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston, fires in the West. And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done.\n",
      "On day one, I will get us back into the international climate change agreement. On day two, I will bring back the clean power rules that President Obama had worked on. On day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards. You can do all that without Congress, which is good.\n",
      "On day four, five, and six I will, working with Congress and mayors and business people all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that  goal. And on day seven, you're supposed to rest, but I won't. This is what we need to do if we're going to get at climate change. We have to take this on as a crisis that's happening right now.\n",
      "RAMOS: Senator Warren, should American foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change?\n",
      "WARREN: Yes. We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet and we are running out of time. Every time the scientists go back, they say, we have less and less time than we thought we had.\n",
      "But that means we've got to use all the tools. One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed following Governor Inslee, that we, by , cut all carbon emissions from new buildings. By , carbon emissions from cars. And by , all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by  percent.\n",
      "We can do this. We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time. Why doesn't it happen? As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we can't make the changes we need to make. We have to attack the corruption head-on so that we can save our planet.

And when I've been in the United States Senate for now the last two-and-a-half years and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children and then when they look at the mirror, I don't know what they see, but it's a lack of courage.\n",

I took on the big oil companies and we saw progress. If any of you have been to Los Angeles,  years ago, you'll remember, that sky was brown. You go there now, the sky is blue and you know why?

      "You're the most vocal proponent on this stage for charter schools. You have said that Democrats who want to limit them are, quote, \"just jumping into bed with teachers unions and doing kids a disservice.\" Why isn't taxpayer money better spent on fixing traditional public schools?\n",

      "We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human worth. [applause]\n",
      "But here's the big one. The data clearly shows that  to  percent of our students outcomes are determined outside of the school. We're talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when they're young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood.\n",
      "We're putting money into schools, and educators know this, we're saying you're  percent responsible for educating your kids but you can only control  percent. They all know this.

      "I believe in public education. And in order to strengthen it, some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips, but we have got to teach more to do with critical thinking and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, we have just got to pay teachers more. And we have got to lift up the teaching profession.\n",
      "I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher. And they kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well. And she came up just short.\n",
      "So, you know what she did? Since she was academically good but couldn't quite make the cut to be a teacher, she had a fall-back plan, she became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession. If we want to get the results that we expect for our children, we have to support and compensate the teaching profession.

      "Mr. Vice president, I want to come to you and talk to you about inequality in schools and race. In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in , you told a reporter, \"I don't feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather, I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I'll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened  years ago.\"\n",
      "You said that some  years ago. But as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, they have to deal with the -- look, there's institutional segregation in this country. And from the time I got involved, I started dealing with that. Red-lining banks, making sure that we are in a position where -- look, you talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title I schools, triple the amount of money we spend from  to $ billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise, the equal raise to getting out -- the $, level.\n",
      "Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home, we need -- we have one school psychologist for every , kids in America today. It's crazy.\n",
      "The teachers are -- I'm married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We have -- make sure that every single child does, in fact, have -, -, and -year-olds go to school. School. Not daycare. School. We bring social workers in to homes and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children.\n",
      "It's not want they don't want to help. They don't -- they don't know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night, the -- the -- make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school -- a very poor background will hear  million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: There's so much we -- no, I'm going to go like the rest of them do, twice over, OK? [applause]\n",
      "Because here's the deal. The deal is that we've got this a little backwards. And by the way, in Venezuela, we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. I've confronted Maduro.\n",
      "Number two, you talk about the need to do something in Latin America. I'm the guy that came up with $ million to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people don't have to chance to leave. You're all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you very much.\n",
      "Secretary Castro?\n",
      "CASTRO: Thank you very much. Well, that's -- that's quite a lot.\n",
      "BIDEN: [off-mike] [laughter]\n",
      "CASTRO: But, you know -- I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about and a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact, in two public school districts that were involved in a  Supreme Court case challenging how Texas financed its schools.\n",
      "And I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now, I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more, that would recruit diverse ranks of teachers, that would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots to uplift the quality of life to invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED, and health care opportunities, and those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper.\n",
      "Those are the types of things that we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools. You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. They're not. [applause]\n",

      "CASTRO: And so while I'm not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now.\n",
      "DAVIS: Senator Booker, coming to you now. It was  years ago this year that the Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation in public schools. Yet for millions of students of color today, segregation remains a reality.\n",
      "Nonwhite districts typically receive $, less per student than those in white districts. This means older books, less access to computers, and often worse outcomes. What is your plan to address segregation? And I'm not just talking about the achievement gap, but I'm talking about the opportunity gap in education.\n",
      "BOOKER: So, I'm hearing a lot of conversations on the stage that -- and the way we talk about communities of color. Look, I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. I've lived in public housing projects almost for a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they don't have a school that serves their genius.\n",
      "I think I'm the only person on the stage -- even though I had no formal authority as mayor to run a school system -- I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools, and we produced results. A lot of folks here are talking about raising teacher salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey.\n",
      "And we didn't stop there. Yeah, we closed poor-performing charter schools, but, dagnabbit, we expanded high-performing charter schools. We were a city that said we need to find local solutions that work for our community. The results speak for themselves. We're now the number-one city in America for Beat the Odds schools, from high poverty to high performance.\n",
      "Strategies like investing in our children work. And I'll tell you this. I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from other issues.\n",
      "That's why my friend, Secretary Castro, is  percent right. We are in the reality we are right now because, Mr. Vice President, of overtly racist policies, not  years ago, just in my lifetime, that were red-lining communities, disinvesting in communities, and more than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation and housing and the challenges of underfunded schools, but they're also struggling with environmental injustice.\n",
      "If you've talked to someone who's a parent of a child has had permanent brain damage because of lead, you'll know this is a national problem, because there's over , jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan.\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "BOOKER: And so if I'm president of the United States, it is a holistic solution to education, from raising teacher salary, fully funded special education, but combatting the issues of poverty, combatting the issues of racial segregation, combatting the issues of a criminal justice system...\n",
      "DAVIS: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "BOOKER: ... that takes parents away from their kids, and dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.\n",

      "STEPHANOPOULOS: And we are now back now for a final round of questions. One question for each candidate. We're going to go in reverse order from the opening statement.\n",
      "And, candidates, the question is on the quality of resilience. No president can succeed without resilience. Every president confronts crises, defeats, and mistakes. So I want to ask each of you, what's the most significant professional setback you've had to face? How did you recover from it? And what did you learn from it?\n",
      "Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: I -- I never counted any professional setback like I have as a serious setback. There's things that are important. Things that are unimportant.\n",

      "BIDEN: I'm sorry.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: We're sorry. Go ahead.\n",
      "BIDEN: There's setbacks, and there's setbacks. And I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose -- well, my dad had an expression. He said, Joey, it's not a question of succeeding, whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. And he said, you never explain and never complain. And then he would go on to say that the only obligation that really matters, the most important thing, is family.\n",
      "And so I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family, and could be judged on based how you treatment your family and how you went from there. And I -- it took -- you know, Kierkegaard said faith sees best in the dark. Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured. And I just had been elected, not sworn in. And I lost my faith for a while. I came back.\n",
      "And then later, when my son Beau came home from Iraq and -- with a terminal disease, and a year later, year-and-a-half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul.\n",
      "But the fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do. And that's why I hope -- I hope he's proud of me today, because he wanted to make sure I didn't run for president, but I stayed engaged, because when you get hit badly, whether you're losing a job or you're raising a family like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid you can't live here anymore, Dad lost his job, you know, we've all been through that, in some form or another.\n",
      "And it just takes -- it just -- for me, the way I've dealt with it is finding purpose. And my purpose is to do what I've always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy. And -- but there's a lot of people been through a lot worse than I have who get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another, without the help I had. There are real heroes out there. Some real heroes.\n",

      "By the time I graduated from high school, my family didn't have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university. And my story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. Got a scholarship, and then at , I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over.\n",
      "I got a chance down the road at the University of Houston. And I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had - to -year-olds.\n",
      "But at the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me -- wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\n",
      "So, there I am, I'm at home, I got a baby, I can't have a job. What am I going to do? Here's resilience. I said, I'll go to law school. And the consequence was -- I practiced law for about  minutes and then went back to my first love, which was teaching.\n",
      "But it let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. And the reason I'm standing here today is because I got back up, I fought back. I know what's broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America. That's why I'm here.\n",

You tell them who you are. [applause]\n",
      "And when I look around the town halls that we do in this race for president of the United States, and I look at the -- the meetings that we do and the community meetings, and I see these little girls and boys, sometimes even brought by their fathers, and they bring them to me and I talk to them during these events, and they smile and they're full of joy, and their fathers tell them, see, don't you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be.

      "I came back from the deployment and realized that you only get to live one life. And I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer, so I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially conservative community.\n",
      "What happened was that, when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and re-elected me with  percent of the vote. And what I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know what's worth more to you than winning.\n",

      "It's about the people who trust us with their lives, a kid wondering if we're actually going to make their schools safe when they've learned active shooter drills before they've learned to read, a generation wondering we will actually get the job done on climate change. And if we hold to that, then it doesn't matter what happens to each of us professionally. Together, we will win a better era for our country.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg, thank you. [applause]\n",
      "Mr. Yang?\n",
      "YANG: I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months and I left to start a business. And I'm going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know you're going to do it. And then you don't have a choice. You put your heart and soul into that. And even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini-rise and maximum fall.\n",
      "I lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars, still owed $, in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer. It was a little easier.\n",
      "So I remember lying on my floor looking up wondering, how did it come to this? Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another  years and eventually had some success.\n",
      "Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. And so I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Nguyen, who's here in the audience tonight, who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me.\n",
      "But the goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Yang. [applause]\n",
      "Senator Booker?\n",
      "BOOKER: So my biggest professional setback is embarrassing because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey, in  took on the political machine and, boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle. And we lost that election.\n",
      "And here's a bit of advice to everybody. If you're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it, because it made for an Oscar-nominated documentary called \"Street Fight.\" But then, unfortunately, another setback. It lost in the Oscars to a movie called \"March of the Dagnab Penguins,\" for crying out loud. [laughter]\n",
      "The people in my community, living in the projects, told me, don't give up on the people and the people won't give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions, and you're going to win. And you know what? We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our city's history.\n",
      "But more than that, the lesson was there. We didn't give up. We were taking on America's toughest problems, from crime to poverty, and we transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system.\n",
      "There's more work to do, but I haven't given up on the people. I still live in that community. But this is a big lesson. My staff and my friends and my community told me, if you want to go fast, you may have won the mayor's race, but that's not what life is about. There's an old African saying that says, if you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.\n",
      "The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. And the test of America right now is not a referendum on Donald Trump, it's a referendum on us and who we are and who we're going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then there's nothing we can't do together as a nation. [applause]\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Booker, thank you.\n",
      "Congressman O'Rourke?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Thank you, George. Everything that I've learned about resilience I've learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas. In the face of this act of terror that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of the United States, that killed  people and injured many more, we were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that.\n",
      "The very thing that drew that killer to us is the very thing that helps us set the example for the rest of this country. We don't see our differences as disqualifying or dangerous. We see them as foundational to our success, to our strength, and to our security, and to our safety.\n",
      "Yesterday, I was visiting with one of those victims. He's the head coach of the Fusion. This is a girls soccer team of - and -year-old girls. His name is Luis. He was shot in the legs multiple times. He was shot in the side multiple times. He's still healing from his wounds in the hospital, but from his hospital bed, he's still trying to coach the Fusion girls soccer team.\n",
      "Memo, his co-coach, is still fighting for his life right now at Del Sol Hospital. Those two men, Jessica and Marcella, their wives, they exemplify resilience to me. And when we end this scourge of gun violence in this country, when we finally confront the racism that exists in America, when we're defined not by our fears, but instead by our aspirations and our ambitions, it will be, in large part, I think, thanks to the example that El Paso has set.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman, thank you.\n",
      "Senator Klobuchar? [applause]\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. My challenges and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And after his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment, with his faith, with his friends, with our family. And in his words, he was pursued by grace. And that made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right, to be pursued by grace.\n",
      "I then got married. My husband's out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter. When our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we're going to have this perfect, perfect birth, and she was really sick, and she couldn't swallow. And she was in and out of hospitals for a year-and-a-half.\n",
      "But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in  hours. She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out. And I thought, this could never happen to any other mom again.\n",
      "So I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a -hour hospital stay. And when they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyists  to . And when they said, when should it take place, they all raised their hands and said now.\n",
      "That is what motivated me to go into public service. And when I got to that gridlock of Washington, D.C., I got to work and pass over  bills, and I know a lot of my friends here from the left, but remember, I am from the middle of the country. And I believe, if we're going to get things done, that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit, someone who's going to not just change the policies, but change the tone in the country, and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity.\n",
      "STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "Secretary Castro?\n",
      "CASTRO: And thank you, George, to Jorge, to Linsey, and to David, and to all of y'all for tuning in tonight. In many ways, I shouldn't be here on this stage. You know, Castro is my mother's name and was my grandmother's name before her. I grew up in a single-parent household on the west side of San Antonio, going to the public schools. Eventually, my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals.\n",
      "And when I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $, a year in the year . A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council. And the city council at the time was only paying $, a year, so everybody had another job. And my job was at the law firm.\n",
      "Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client and the client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn't think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it.\n",
      "But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas -- because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules -- you can't just go against the interest of a client. So I was stuck.\n",
      "On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment, depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out.\n",
      "So, one day, I walked into my law firm and I quit my job. And then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council. [applause]\n",
      "And, you know, it was the first test that I had, and I think back to that, because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics as dirty or corrupting. I wondered, before I went in it, whether it was change who I was. And I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent, and not for big special interests.\n",
      "There's nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the president of the United States. This president has failed that test. But I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won't. I won't serve anybody except you and your family. And together, we can create an American that's better than ever. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Senator Harris, this week you released a new health care plan which would preserve private insurance and take  years to phase in. Vice President Biden's campaign calls your plan, quote, \"a have-it-every-which-way approach\" and says it's just part of a confusing pattern of equivocating about your health care stance. What do you say to that?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, they're probably confused because they've not read it. But the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families, listening to experts, listening to health care providers, and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people, responsive to their needs understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long, that American families have to be held down by deductibles and co-pays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.\n",
      "I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan, so I devised a plan where it's going to be  years of a transition.\n",
      "I listened to American families who said I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where, yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan, under my plan for Medicare, and a private plan, under my plan for Medicare.\n",
      "Because the bottom line is this: We must agree that access to health care must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people -- in fact,  million people -- are going without access to health care.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Biden, your response.\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, my response is that the senator has had several plans so far. And any time someone tells you you're going to get something good in  years, you should wonder why it takes  years.\n",
      "If you noticed, there is no talk about the fact that the plan in  years will cost $ trillion. You will lose your employer-based insurance. And in fact, you know, this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with double-talk on this plan.\n",
      "BASH: Your response, Senator Harris?\n",
      "HARRIS: Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing. The reality is that our plan will bring health care to all Americans under a Medicare for All system.\n",
      "Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan, and right now,  million babies almost are born every day in America -- or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to health care.\n",
      "Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost  million Americans. So I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to health care and do not want cost to be their barrier to getting it.\n",
      "BASH: Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: The plan, no matter how you cut it, costs $ trillion when it is, in fact, employed, number one. Ten years from now, after two terms of the senator being president, after her time.\n",
      "Secondly, it will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down. Thirdly, it will eliminate employer-based insurance. And fourthly, what happens in the meantime?\n",
      "HARRIS: I'd like to respond. First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. Second, we are now paying $ trillion a year for health care in America. Over the next  years, it's probably going to be $ trillion. We must act.\n",
      "My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage. Right now in America, we have seniors, who every day -- millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need. All people should have access to health care. And costs should not be their barrier.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator Harris.\n",
      "Mayor de Blasio, let's bring you in here. What's your response?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Thank you. I don't know what the vice president and the senator are talking about. The folks I talk to about health insurance say that their health insurance isn't working for them.\n",
      "There's tens of millions of Americans who don't even have health insurance, tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out-of-pocket expenses.\n",
      "There's this mythology that somehow all of these folks are in love with their insurance in America. What I hear from union members and from hard-working, middle-class people is they wish they had better insurance and they're angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental care...\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: ... dental care, the things that would be full coverage for all Americans.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, you just heard Mayor de Blasio. He said in the past that Democrats who wanted to keep the private insurance industry are defending a health care system that is not working. What's your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: My response is, Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and do -- take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into that option if they didn't like their employer plan, or if they're on Medicaid, they'd automatically be in the plan.\n",
      "It would take place immediately. It would move quickly. And it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans.\n",
      "In the meantime, what happens? Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost? My plan costs $ billion. That's what it costs. Not $ trillion.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Senator Gillibrand, you support Medicare for All. How do you feel about Senator Harris continuing to call her health proposal Medicare for All, when it includes a far more significant role for private insurance than the bill you co-sponsored?\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: I think for the viewers in the audience right now, they're at risk of losing the forest through the trees, because the truth is, health care in America should be a right.\n",
      "When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant, he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy. I had to rush him to the emergency room. My heart is palpitating because I'm worried that his throat will close. I am not worried about not having an insurance card or a credit card in my wallet. I know whatever they're going to prescribe, whether it's an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it.\n",
      "The truth about health care in America today is people can't afford it. They cannot afford -- and the insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I'm sorry, they're for-profit companies. They have an obligation to their shareholders. They pay their CEO millions of dollars. They have to have quarterly profits.\n",
      "They have fat in the system that's real and it should be going to health care. So let's not lose the forest for the trees.\n",
      "And last, let's not forget what the Republicans are doing, because the truth is, the Republicans and Trump, their whole goal is to take away your health care.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you.\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: To make it harder for you to afford it, even if you have pre-existing conditions.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. Senator Harris, your response? [applause]\n",
      "HARRIS: In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act, it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective ways to bring health care to all. Kathleen Sebelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go.\n",
      "In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldn't agree more. Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo, doing business as usual, and that's going to be about jacking up co-pays, jacking up deductibles...\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator.\n",

      "BIDEN: My plan makes a limit of co-pay to be $,, because we further support the -- the ability to buy into the Obamacare plan.\n",
      "Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but they - if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance.\n",
      "It says, if the  million who have it say they like their employer insurance, they should have a right to have it. If they don't, they can buy into the Biden plan, which is Obamacare with -\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Thank you. Senator Booker, let me bring you in here. You say you support Medicare for All. You also say you are not going to pull private health insurance from more than  million Americans in exchange for a government plan, but that's what Medicare for All would do.\n",
      "So how do you square that?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, let me just say, that the person that's enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other, while he is working right now to take away Americans' healthcare. There is a court case working through the system that's going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on preexisting conditions.\n",
      "And so, I was raised by two civil rights parents who told me, always keep your eyes on the prize. And that is that in the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare, that it's a human right. And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way, just a handful of years of literally spending  percent of our economy, one out of every $ spent on healthcare.\n",
      "And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple mores than other countries - multiple more than other countries. And so, do you want to know what I'm going to do? I'm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for All - where everyone is covered.\n",
      "But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn't care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in face of the real enemy here. And I'm -\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. [applause]\n",
      "BOOKER: - going to keep fighting for that.\n",
      "BASH: Congressman Gabbard, what's your response?\n",
      "GABBARD: The reality is right now, we don't have a healthcare system. We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it. So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies who've been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table, writing this legislation.\n",
      "Now, Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sebelius who helped write her bill. This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal. Sebelius works for Medicare Advantage, a private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan. If we're seeking to really reform our healthcare system, we've got to shut out big insurance and big pharma out of the drafting process so they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care.\n",
      "BASH: Senior Harris, your response? [applause]\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, unfortunately, Representative Gabbard got it wrong. Kathleen Sebelius did not write my plan; she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyone is going to have access to healthcare in America. And when we talk about this again, I'm going to back to Vice President Biden, because your plan does not cover everyone in America.\n",
      "By your staffs and your own definition,  million people - as many as  million people will not have access to healthcare. And in  in America, for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse. Our plan covers everyone -\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "HARRIS: - and gives people choice\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: My plan does - will cover everyone, number one. Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices. The biopharma is now where things are going to go. It's no longer chemicals. It's about all these breakthroughs that we have, with the whole - excuse me, immune system.\n",
      "And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in HHS and says, as you develop a drug, you got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for. We will set the price. And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I want to bring in Senator Bennet. Last night, on this stage, one of your democratic rivals suggested that running on Medicare for All would get Donald Trump reelected.\n",
      "BENNET: I agree that it makes it much more likely. Unlike others on this stage, I've been crystal clear of where I've been for a decade, through two tough races in Colorado. I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family, whether they want private insurance or public insurance.\n",
      "It requires the drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare and it provides competition. That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer based health insurance in this country and massively raise taxes on the middle class to the tune of $ trillion.\n",
      "As Joe Biden said, we don't need to do that. It doesn't make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and -- and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room when we pass a public option, trust the American people to make the right decision, and have universal healthcare in this country in two years, not  years.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, I want to bring you in ...\n",
      "HARRIS: I -- I need to respond.\n",
      "TAPPER: Your response. I'll come to you right after Secretary Castro. Secretary Castro.\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans. You know I grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes and I watched as her condition got worse and worse. That whole time she had Medicare.\n",
      "I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe thought that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong that they want to hold on to that they should be able to do that.\n",
      "What I don't believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine, in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Secretary Castro. Senator Harris, Senator Bennet had suggested that you support banning employer based health insurance. Is that true?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well first of all, with all due respect to my friend, Michael Bennet, my plan does not offer anything that is illegal. What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be a -- where -- the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work.\n",
      "I have me met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like, where they are not prospering simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides. It's time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get and under my plan; we do that as it relates to the insurance and the pharmaceutical companies ....\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "HARRIS: Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennet's plan ...\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "HARRIS: We will do that.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Bennet, I want to bring you back.\n",
      "BENNET: Senator Harris is my friend as well, but I have to say if we can't admit -- if we can't admit tonight what's in the plan, which is banning employer based insurance, we're not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing democrats of doing that as well.\n",
      "We need to be honest about what's in this plan. It bans employer based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $ trillion. Do you know how much that is? That is  percent of what the government will collect in taxes over the next  years.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "BENNET: We don't need to do that.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "We can have a public option to have universal healthcare in this country.\n",
      "TAPPER: I do want to bring in Senator Harris because he just suggested you were not being honest.\n",
      "HARRIS: He -- we cannot keep with the republican talking points on this. You got to stop. The reality is that - what -- under my Medicare for All plan, yes, employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision.\n",
      "Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, will be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only. They want choice and my plan gives that to them.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank. Thank you, Senator. Governor Inslee, I want to bring you in. You recently signed a public option into law, which allows Washington State residents to purchase a state backed plan if they want to.\n",
      "But this may only save families in Washington State as little as  percent off premiums. Is  percent really the kind of relief that the American people need?\n",
      "INSLEE: No, we need universal coverage. And I'm proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done. And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publically sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens.\n",
      "I'm also proud that we didn't stop there. We're also the first state that has taken care of our elders, our seniors. We have a looming retirement wave coming up. I'm proud that our state -- our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity.\n",
      "I'm also proud of this and I think we need to talk more about this as democrats, it is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country. And we are -- we are ... [applause]\n",
      "We are having -- we've had some success in integrating mental health with physical health. There's no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health.\n",
      "And the last thing we're doing, I think it's very instructive for the nation. We know we're being eaten alive by pharmaceutical cost. We have had one of, if not the most, innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life saving medications in the United States.\n",
      "We have had one of, if not the most innovative way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life-saving medications in the United States. That's a record of Washington state I'd like to take to Washington, D.C.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you, Governor Inslee.\n",
      "Mr. Yang, I want to bring you in. You support a Medicare for All system. How do you respond to Governor Inslee?\n",
      "YANG: Well, I just want to share a story. When I told my wife I was running for president, you know the first question she asked me? What are we going to do about our health care?\n",
      "That's a true story, and it's not just us. Democrats are talking about health care in the wrong way. As someone who's run a business, I can tell you flat out our current health care system makes it harder to hire, it makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees, it makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and it's certainly a lot harder to start a business.\n",
      "If we say, look, we're going to get health care off the backs of businesses and families, then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom. That's the argument we should be making to the American people. [applause]\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Yang.\n",
      "Mayor de Blasio?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Yeah, I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fearmongering about universal health care. It makes no sense. Ask the American people, they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them. Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies. They feel it's holding back their families because they can't get the coverage they need. They get a lot of noes. They don't get a lot of help from health insurance companies.\n",
      "Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold, that says we don't need to be dependent on private insurance? We can have a system that actually covers everyone. You know what? Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo. How about we be the party that's going to disrupt the status quo for working people?\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you. Mr. Mayor, just a -second point of clarification. Who are you talking about? Who's fearmongering?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what he's saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes. Americans right now are paying so much money for their health care, ask people about the reality of premiums, deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket expenses.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: That's worse than any tax, and people are paying that right now.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "Senator Bennet?\n",
      "BENNET: This -- this is -- this has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry. This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families and they can choose a public option.\n",
      "Bernie Sanders, who said last night he wrote the damn bill, and he did, just like I wrote the damn public option bill, is the guy who says it will cost $ trillion and that we're going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it. He says that. Republicans don't say it. Don't try to district from the truth.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator Bennet.\n",
      "BENNET: You can't hide from the truth.\n",
      "TAPPER: I want to let Mayor de Blasio -- and then I'm going to come to you, Vice President Biden.\n",
      "BENNET: We need to be for universal health care.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Senator, if we as Democrats say we're done with private insurance, has only hurt the American people in so many ways, we're going to give them something that works for their family's full coverage that they can depend on. If we say that, then there's an election. The American people get to decide.\n",
      "The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election, and this should be the party that stands for universal health care and says we're not going to accept anything less. Right now, in America, so many people don't have the health care they need. That is a fact. Tens of millions of people, including middle class people.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Give them a chance to make that decision through an election.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "Vice President Biden, your response, sir?\n",
      "BIDEN: This is not a Republican talking point. The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare. Obamacare took care of  million people right off the bat,  million people with pre-existing conditions. And in fact, what we got is a public option that, in fact, would allow anybody to buy in.\n",
      "No one has to keep their private insurance. They can buy into this plan. And they can buy into it with $, deductible and never have to pay more than . percent of their income when they do it. And if they don't have any money, they'll get in free. So this idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we're talking about here. [applause]\n",
      "The fact of the matter is -- the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible. It will be a deductible on their paycheck. Bernie acknowledges it. Bernie acknowledges it. Thirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid. And I don't know what math you do in New York, I don't know what math you do in California, but I tell ya, that's a lot of money, and there will be a deductible. The deductible will be out of your paycheck, because that's what will be required.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Harris, I want to bring you in here. Your response? [applause]\n",
      "HARRIS: Yeah, let's talk about math. Let's talk about math. Let's talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year alone profited $ billion, and that is on the backs of American families.\n",
      "And under your plan, status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families. In America today, diabetes patients, one in four cannot afford their insulin. In America today...\n",

      "They are misrepresenting to the American people what needs to be done.\n",
      "And, lastly, here's the deal. The deal is, let's figure out how this works. We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don't like, no matter what one it is, and buy into a Medicare option. And they can buy the gold plan, and they're not going to have to pay -- anyway...\n",

      "Let's move now to immigration, please. Secretary Castro, you think it should no longer be a crime to cross the U.S. border illegally. President Obama's homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, whom you served with, says that is a public declaration that the border is, quote, \"effectively open to all.\" How is he wrong?\n",
      "CASTRO: Thank you for that question. You know, if you elect me president, you're not electing me to follow. You're electing me to lead. And open borders is a right-wing talking point, and frankly I'm disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage, have taken the bait.\n",
      "The only way that we're going to guarantee that we don't have family separations in this country again is to repeal Section  of the Immigration Nationality Act. That is the law that this president, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.\n",
      "My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who haven't committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship, that we do a st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that we can get to the root of this challenge so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come to the United States. That's how we can be smarter, more effective, and more humane when it comes to immigration policy.\n",

      "Senator Bennet, what's your response?\n",
      "BENNET: I disagree that we should decriminalize our border. This is personal for me. My mom is an immigrant, and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland.\n",
      "And for those reasons, I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote -- I wrote the immigration bill in  with John McCain that passed the Senate with  votes, that gave a pathway to citizenship for the  million undocumented people that are here, that would pass the most progressive DREAM Act that had ever been conceived, much less passed on the floor of the Senate, and had $ billion of border security. Every single Democrat voted for that bill...\n",

      "And by the way, there were members of us -- Julian was there, members of Congress, they would not let us enter the place, members of the United States Congress. So I walked down the road, I climbed a ladder, and I looked over the fence. And I'm going to tell you what I saw. I saw children lined up single file based on gender being walked into barracks. The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the books...\n",

      "That is what this administration has done in the American people's name. They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility.

      "GILLIBRAND: So I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who we're talking about. When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence. A woman from El Salvador owned a small business, gangs came to her and said if you don't give us all your money, we're going to kill your family. That's why she fled.\n",
      "Another woman was raped.\n",
      "That's why she fled.\n",
      "So this is who we're talking about -- and they're not criminals. So I believe that we should have a civil violation. No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it. Because he's using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars.\n",
      "So I don't think we should have a law on the books that can be so misused. It should be a civil violation and we should make sure that we treat people humanely.\n",

      "BIDEN: Absolutely not, number one. Number two, everything landed on the president's desk but locusts. I found that Julian -- excuse me -- the secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary.\n",

      "BIDEN: I don't know if you can hear. I can hear. But anyway...\n",
      "LEMON: We can hear fine, Mr. Vice President.\n",
      "BIDEN: OK. [laughter]\n",
      "LEMON: Please continue, if you will.\n",
      "BIDEN: The fact is what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. That woman, the women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly.\n",
      "With regard to -- with regard to the secretary's point, I already proposed and passed...[applause]...$ million for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, to be able to change the circumstance why people fled in the first place.\n",
      "In addition to that, we're in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing to come to the United States and make their case, that they don't -- that they have to wait in line. The fact of the matter is, you should be able to -- if you cross the border illegally, you should be able to be sent back. It's a crime. It's a crime, and it's not one that in fact...\n",
      "LEMON: Thank -- thank you, Mr. Vice President. Secretary Castro, please, your response? [applause]\n",
      "CASTRO: Yeah, first of all, Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't. [applause]\n",
      "Let me begin by telling you -- let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that.\n",
      "BIDEN: I agree.\n",
      "CASTRO: Secondly, the only way that we're going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don't happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. There's still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. It's a civil action. Also, we have  miles of fencing. We have thousands of personnel at the border. We have planes; we have boats; we have helicopters; we have security cameras...\n",
      "LEMON: Secretary Castro, thank you.\n",

      "LEMON: Thank you, Secretary. [applause]\n",
      "Mr. Vice President, please, your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: I have guts enough to say his plan doesn't make sense. Here's the deal. The fact of the matter is that, in fact, when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless they're seeking asylum. People should have to get in line. That's the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice. [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you. Congresswoman Gabbard, what's your response?\n",
      "GABBARD: Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities who've been separated from their parents, when we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions. This is about leadership and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies.\n",
      "We will have to stop separating children from their parents, make it so that it's easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws.\n",
      "LEMON: Mr. Yang, your response? [applause]\n",
      "YANG: I'm the son of immigrants myself. My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over  U.S. patents for G.E. and IBM. I think that's a pretty good deal for the United States. That's the immigration story we need to be telling.\n",
      "We can't always be focusing on some of the -- the -- the distressed stories. And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall-to-wall immigrants; you will find wall-to-wall robots and machines. Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy. [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Mr. Yang. Senator Booker you have a plan that would, quote, \"virtually eliminate immigration detention.\" Does that mean that the roughly , migrants currently in detention would be released into the United States?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, I just want to say, again, tonight, we are playing into Republican hands who have a very different view, and they're trying to divide us against each other. I'm listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border. An unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing, if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do in the criminal courts.\n",
      "But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights. And so, doing it through the civil courts means that you won't need these awful detention facilities that I have been to; seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children.\n",
      "This is not necessary. We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have  percent compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned. If they are, like the people I met in Juarez, who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn't even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values -\n",
      "LEMON: Senator -\n",
      "BOOKER: - and making ourselves less safe.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Booker, thank you very much. Mr. Vice President, your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: I agree with the Senator. The asylum process is a real process, and this president is ruining it. It has nothing to do with that section of law. That's what he's doing, number one. Number two, we should in fact - and we had proposed and we tried to get passed in our administration, I proposed, significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come.\n",
      "This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people. And the reason we're the country we are is we've been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country. That's why we're so special. It took courage. It took resilience. It took absolutely confidence for them to come. And we should be encouraging these people.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you.\n",
      "BIDEN: And by the way, anybody that crosses the stage with a - with a - with a PhD, you should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Governor Inslee, what's your response?\n",
      "INSLEE: I think we're missing two central statements we need to make. Number one, we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House, number one. [applause]\n",
      "And number two - number two, we have to make America what it's always been, a place of refuge. We got to boost the number of people we accept. I'm proud of being the first governor saying send us your Syrian refugees. I'm proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's Muslim ban. I'm proud to have sued him  times and beat him  times in a row. I'm ready for November . [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Go ahead. Mayor de Blasio, please your response?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Two points. One, it's all kind of charade because there's  million people here, and everyone, in theory, has broken the law, but they're part of our communities now. They're part of our economy. They're our neighbors. Why are we even discussing on one level whether it's a civil penalty or a criminal penalty, when it's an American reality?\n",
      "And what we need is comprehensive immigration, once and for all, to fix it. Second, Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations. You were vice president of the United States. I didn't hear whether you tried to stop them or not, using your power, your influence in the White House. Do you think it was a good idea, or do you think it was something that needed to be stopped?\n",
      "LEMON: Mr. Vice President -\n",
      "BIDEN: The president came along, and he's the guy that came up with the idea the first time ever, dealing with the dreamers. He put that in the law. He had talked about a comprehensive plan which he put on the - laid before the Congress, saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that we're able to bring in to this country.\n",
      "Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it where people were leaving in the first place. So he did - to compare him to Donald Trump, I think is absolutely bizarre.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Congresswoman Gabbard, you are a co-sponsor of the College for All Act which would make public colleges and universities free for all Americans. One of the authors of that plan, Senator Sanders, believes college should be tuition-free for undocumented immigrants as well. Do you?\n",
      "GABBARD: I don't. I think it's important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as they've been living in the shadows.\n",
      "And instead of putting a band-aid on this problem, fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenships, that they are no longer treated as second-class citizens in this country. We've got to look at the challenge that people all across the country are facing, under crushing student debt.\n",
      "This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it. This is about promise for our future and we've got to make those kinds of investments.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Congresswoman. Mayor de Blasio, what's your response?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Yes, I -- I agree with the congress member but I don't hear an answer from the vice president. I'm confused. I asked the vice president point blank, did he use his power to stop those deportations. He went right around the question.\n",
      "Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you if you're debating Donald Trump he's not going to let you off the hook. So did you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say this is a mistake, we shouldn't do it. Which one?\n",
      "BIDEN: I was vice president. I am not the president. I keep my recommendation to him in private. Unlike you I can expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him. That is not what I do.\n",
      "What I do say to you is he moved to fundamentally change the system. That's what he did. That's who did. But much more has to be done. Much more has to be done.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: I still don't hear an answer.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Booker, please respond.\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, a couple of things. First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.\n",
      "And the second thing that this really urkes me because I heard the vice president say that if you got a PhD., you can come right into this country. Well that's playing into what the republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants.\n",
      "From are from shithole countries and some are from worthy countries. We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity and this should be a country that honors for everyone. [applause]\n",
      "Don't let the republicans divide this party against itself.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator, thank you. Mr. Vice President, your response.\n",
      "BIDEN: The fact is that's what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants. All of us. All of us. Some here came against their will; others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives. And they did.\n",
      "[Inaudible] that's what we're talking about. That's what made us great. And the fact of the matter is, I think the president of the United States, Barack Obama, went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: Again, President Trump, under his administration seven children died in his custody. In -- under his administration families have been torn apart. This party is talking about real ideas for the future. We're talking about what we will do to change America.\n",
      "But we must not forget about our values. We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated. We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us. Let's remind the American people who we are, why we are democrats, and why we're running for president.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much. The debate will be right back right after this short break.\n",
      "TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate. We are live from Detroit.\n",
      "I want to turn now to criminal justice. Mr. Vice President, Senator Booker called your new criminal justice reform plan, quote, \"an inadequate solution to what is a raging crisis in our country,\" unquote. Why is Senator Booker wrong?\n",
      "BIDEN: Well, I don't -- I think he is wrong. I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons.\n",
      "Right now, we're in a situation where, when someone is convicted of a drug crime, they end up going to jail and to prison. They should be going to rehabilitation. They shouldn't be going to prison. When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals.\n",
      "And when they get out of prison, they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they would have had before, including Pell grants for education, including making sure that they're able to have housing, public housing, including they have all the opportunities that were available to them because we want them to become better citizens.\n",
      "That's the essence of what my plan, in detail, lays out. I'm happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator would want to. And so I -- you know, I look -- anyway, that's what I think my plan -- I know what my plan does, and I think it's not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Booker, your response?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty, mental health and addiction with locking people up and not lifting them up.\n",
      "And...[applause]...Mr. Vice President has said that, since the s, every major crime bill -- every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it. And, Sir, those are your words, not -- not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can't just now come out with a plan to put out that fire. We have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform, like having true...\n",

      "TAPPER: Vice President Biden, I want to give you a chance to respond.\n",
      "BIDEN: The fact is that the bills that the president -- that, excuse me, the future president here -- that...[laughter]...that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelming. Since , I, for example, tried to get the crack-powder-cocaine totally -- disparity totally eliminated.\n",
      "In  you became mayor and you had a police department that was -- you went out and you hired Rudy Giuliani's guy; you -- and engaged in stop-and-frisk. You had  percent of those stops reviewed as illegal. You found yourself in a situation where three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up. The Justice Department came after you for saying you were -- you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you. Senator Booker, you want to respond?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, first of all, I'm grateful that he endorsed my presidency already. But I'll tell you this, it's no secret that I inherited a criminal -- a police department with massive problems and decades-long challenges. But the head of the ACLU has already said -- the head of the New Jersey ACLU -- that I put forth national standard-setting accountability.\n",
      "BIDEN: That's...\n",
      "BOOKER: Mr. Vice President -- Mr. Vice President, I didn't interrupt you. Please show me that respect, sir.\n",
      "BIDEN: I'm sorry [inaudible]\n",
      "BOOKER: We have a system right now that's broken. And if you want to compare records -- and, frankly, I'm shocked that you do...[laughter]...I am happy to do that. Because all the problems that he is talking about, that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you were, frankly -- to correct you, Mr. Vice President -- you were bragging, calling it the Biden crime bill, up until .\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden?\n",
      "BIDEN: Number one, the bill he talks about is a bill that in my -- our administration, we passed. We passed that bill that you added onto. That's the bill, in fact, you passed.\n",
      "And the fact of the matter is, secondly, there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor, there was nothing done to deal with the police department that was corrupt. Why did you announce on the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giuliani's guy in , when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine disparity?\n",
      "BOOKER: Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community, you're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor. You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place. The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms not just in action, but in deeds.\n",
      "Sir, you are trying to shift the view from what you created. There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that \"tough on crime\" phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine. This isn't about the past, sir. This is about the present right now. I believe in redemption.\n",

      "CASTRO: Yeah, I agree with Senator Booker -- I agree with Senator Booker that a lot of what Vice President helped author in ' was a mistake. And he has flip-flopped on these things. And that's clear.\n",
      "But let me say, when we talk about criminal justice reform, there are a lot of things that we can talk about -- sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs. I'm proud that I'm the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan, because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it.\n",
      "And whether it's the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner, where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue challenges...[applause]...we need to ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.\n",

      "And importantly, we've done this: When people come out of the legal system and they've done their responsibility to the citizens, we need to make sure they can get a job. We have banned the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out. [applause]\n",
      "And I've got to argue with my friend, Secretary Castro. We haven't just put forward a plan. We have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and trainer police officers and de-escalation techniques so we have less violence...\n",

He did that for seven seconds. Eleven different times Eric Garner said that he couldn't breathe. He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street. [applause]\n",

      "You know why? Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal Justice Department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the Justice Department was pursuing their prosecution. And years went by, and a lot of the pain accrued.\n",

      "And so the fact is that there's a lot we've done. But here's the deal. The fact is that we're talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago. And now, all of a sudden, you know -- I find it fascinating. Everybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had  lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties, and he chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made. I'll take his judgment.\n",

      "Senator Harris, you have also been quite critical of Vice President Biden's policies on race, specifically on the issues of busing in the s, having benefitted from busing when you were a young child. Vice President Biden says that your current position on busing, you're opposed to federally mandated busing, that that position is the same as his position. Is he right?\n",
      "HARRIS: That is simply false. And let's be very clear about this. When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate, working with segregationists to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate America's public schools, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle.\n",
      "And let's be clear about this. Had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate, Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate, and Barack Obama would not have been in the position to nominate him to the title he now holds. [applause]\n",
      "And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time.\n",
      "Now, I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner, because I, too, met with his mother. And one of the things that we've got to be clear about is that this president of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office, has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations.\n",
      "On that case, we also know that the...\n",

      "HARRIS: ... Civil Rights Division -- this is important. The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped -- and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward.

      "TAPPER: Vice President Biden, Vice President Biden, I want to give you a chance to respond to what Senator Harris just said.\n",
      "BIDEN: When Senator Harris was attorney general for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country, in Los Angeles and in San Francisco.\n",
      "And she did not -- I didn't see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them. Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's right.\n",
      "And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorney's like me that you in fact have been -- the police officer did something that did not give you information of what [inaudible] your -- your client. She didn't do that. She never did it. And so what happened.\n",
      "Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough. And he freed , of these people. If you doubt me, google , prisoners freed, Kamala Harris.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Vice President Biden. Senator Harris, your response.\n",
      "HARRIS: That is -- is simply not true. And as attorney general of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did.\n",
      "Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades.\n",
      "It was the work of creating the -- one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "HARRIS: I did the work as attorney general of putting body cameras on special agents in the state of California.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "TAPPER: I want to bring in Congresswoman ....\n",
      "HARRIS: And I'm proud of that work.\n",
      "TAPPER: I want to bring in Congresswoman Gabbard. Congresswoman Gabbard, you took issue with Senator Harris confronting Vice President Biden at the last debate. You called it a quote, false accusation that Joe Biden is a racist. What's your response?\n",
      "GABBARD: I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today. Now Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president.\n",
      "But I'm deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite but she put over , people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. [applause]\n",
      "She blocked evidence -- she blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California. [applause]\n",
      "And she fought to keep ...\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Congresswoman.\n",
      "GABBARD: Bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Harris, your response? [applause]\n",
      "HARRIS: As the elected attorney general of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of  million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.\n",
      "And I am proud of that work. And I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform.\n",
      "That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you.\n",
      "HARRIS: It is why and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken ...\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "HARRIS: That I am an advocate for what we need to do to not only decriminalize, but legalize marijuana in the United States.\n",
      "[crosstalk]\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Your time is up. I want to -- I want to bring Congresswoman Gabbard back in. Your response, please.\n",
      "GABBARD: The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these people's lives, you did not. And worse yet, in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so. [applause]\n",
      "There is no excuse for that and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor owe -- you owe them an apology.\n",
      "TAPPER: Senator Harris? [applause]\n",
      "HARRIS: My entire career I have been opposed -- personally opposed to the death penalty and that has never changed. And I dare anybody who is in a position to make that decision, to face the people I have faced to say I will not seek the death penalty. That is my background, that is my work.\n",
      "I am proud of it. I think you can judge people by when they are under fire and it's not about some fancy opinion on a stage but when they're in the position to actually make a decision, what do they do.\n",
      "When I was in the position of having to decide whether or not to seek a death penalty on cases I prosecuted, I made a very difficult decision that was not popular to not seek the death penalty. History shows that and I am proud of those decisions.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Harris, thank you very much. Senator Bennet, a question for you. Why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide that exists in this country today, which has been stoked by the president's racist rhetoric?\n",
      "BENNET: Yes. First of all, the president's racist rhetoric should be enough grounds for everybody in this country to vote him out of office.\n",
      "That one thing alone should be enough. [applause]\n",
      "Second, Don, I want to answer your question by tagging on the conversation we were just having. This is the fourth debate that we have had and the second time that we have been debating what people did  years ago with busing...[applause]...when our schools are as segregated today as they were  years ago. [applause]\n",
      "We need a conversation about what's happening now. And when there's a group of kids in this country that don't get preschool through no fault of their own and another group does, equal is not equal. And we've got a group of K- schools that are good because families can spend a million bucks, and you've got the Detroit public schools that are as segregated as they were. Equal is not equal. [applause]\n",
      "And let me tell you something else, Don. I believe you can draw a straight line from slavery through Jim Crow through the banking and the redlining to the mass incarceration that we were talking about on this stage a few minutes ago. But you know what other line I can draw? Eighty-eight percent of the people in our prisons dropped out of high school. Let's fix our school system and maybe we can fix the prison pipeline that we have. [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Senator Bennet. [applause]\n",
      "Governor Inslee, what's your response? [applause]\n",
      "Governor Inslee, please respond.\n",
      "INSLEE: You know, I approach this question with humility because I have not experienced what many Americans have. I've never been a black teenager pulled over in a white neighborhood. I've never been a woman talked over in a meeting. I've never been an LGBTQ member subject to a slur. And so I have believed I have an added responsibility, a double responsibility, to deal with racial disparity. And we've talked on the way we do it, including ending -- ending the school to prison pipeline in my state.\n",
      "But I want to say this. And this is a common error that every single senator on this stage, as much as I respect them all -- they all have an enormous error which is going to prevent our party from making any progressive progress in the United States, and it is this. We are all going to work like the dickens to get more Democrats elected to the Senate, right? We are going to do that. [applause]\n",
      "And I hope we're going to succeed. But if we get a majority in the U.S. Senate, because of the position of these senators, not a damn thing is going to get done. And I'll tell you why. With all their good intentions -- and I know they're very sincere and passionate and I respect them enormously -- but because they embraced this antediluvinal super-majority thing called the filibuster, Mitch McConnell is going to run the U.S. Senate even if we take a majority.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you.\n",
      "INSLEE: We've got to get rid of the filibuster so we can govern the United States.\n",
      "LEMON: Mister... [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Mr. Yang, why are you the best candidate to heal the racial divide in America -- your response?\n",
      "YANG: I spent seven years running a non-profit that helped create thousands of jobs, including hundreds right here in Detroit, as well as Baltimore, Cleveland, New Orleans. And I saw that the racial disparities are much, much worse than I had ever imagined.\n",
      "They're even worse still. A study just came out that projected the average African-American median net worth will be zero by . So you have to ask yourself, how is that possible? It's possible because we're in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our history. Artificial intelligence is coming. It's going to displace hundreds of thousands of call center workers, truck drivers -- the most common job in  states, including this one.\n",
      "And you know who suffers most in a natural disaster? It's people of color, people who have lower levels of capital and education and resources. So what are we going to do about it? We should just go back to the writings of Martin Luther King, who in , his book \"Chaos or Community\", said \"We need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America.\" That is the most effective way for us to address racial inequality in a genuine way and give every American a chance in the st Century economy. [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Mr. Yang, thank you very much.\n",
      "Secretary Castro, after the president's racist tweets attacking Baltimore and Congressman Elijah Cummings, the mayor of Baltimore slammed the tweets and said to the president -- and I quote here -- \"Help us. Send the resources that we need to rebuild America.\"\n",
      "So what would you do for Baltimore and other cities that need help?\n",
      "CASTRO: First of all, the president is a racist, and that was just one more example of it. [applause]\n",
      "We know that, whether it's Baltimore or cities like Detroit, they have -- they're tremendously rich in history and culture and also in possibility. Here's what I would do if I'm president. Number one, I would invest in tremendous educational opportunity; invest in universal pre-K for three and four-year-olds; invest in improving K- education and also making higher education available to everyone through tuition-free public state universities, community colleges and job training and certification programs. I would follow-up on the work that I did at HUD. We passed the most sweeping rule to further desegregate our communities in the United States.\n",
      "This Trump administration set that back. I would put that back in order. I would also invest in housing that is affordable, because folks know that the rent is going through the roof. And we need to make sure that you don't have to get out of West Baltimore, or Inner City Detroit, or the west side of San Antonio, or anywhere, if you want to reach your American dream. I want you to be able to accomplish it in your great neighborhood where you are.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Secretary Castro. Senator Gillibrand, what's your response?\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: So I don't believe that it's the responsibility of Cory and Kamala to be the only voice that takes on these issues of institutional racism, systemic racism in our country. I think as a white woman of privilege, who is a U.S. senator, running for president of the United States, it is also my responsibility to lift up those voices that aren't being listened to.\n",
      "And I can talk to those white women in the suburbs that voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is, that when their son is walking down a street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot. [applause]\n",
      "When his - when her - when their child has a car that breaks down, and he knocks on someone's door for help, and the door opens, and the help is given, it's his whiteness that protects him from being shot. That is what white privilege in America is today. And so, my responsibility's to only lift up those stories, but explain to communities across America, like I did in Youngstown, Ohio, to a young mother, that this is all of our responsibilities, and that together we can make our community stronger.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator Gillibrand. [applause]\n",
      "Let's now turn to the issue of the climate crisis. The United Nations says the world needs to cut all carbon emissions by  or risk facing disastrous consequences. Governor Inslee, many of your fellow democratic candidates say that climate change is the biggest existential threat facing the country. You, though, are calling it the number one priority in your campaign. What do you know that the others don't?\n",
      "INSLEE: Well, I know the firsthand terrific impact of climate change on Americans across the country already. The family who I saw, with their aluminum home now, just a pile of molten aluminum, they lost everything in the paradise of fires; the non-profit in Davenport that was washed away in the floods. We have to act now.\n",
      "Look, climate change is not a singular issue, it is all the issue that we Democrats care about. It is health. It is national security. It is our economy. And we know this; middle ground solutions, like the vice president has proposed, or sort of middling average-sized things, are not going to save us.\n",
      "Too little, too late is too dangerous. And we have to have a bold plan, and mine has been called the \"gold standard.\" Now, we also need to embed environmental justice. I was in zip code  in the Detroit neighborhood the other day, right next to an oil refinery, where the kids have asthma and they have cancer clusters. And after talking to these folks, I believe this -\n",

      "BASH: Vice President Biden, I'd like to get you to respond. [applause]\n",
      "Governor Inslee just said that your plan is middling.\n",
      "BIDEN: There is no middle ground about my plan. The fact of the matter is I call for the immediate action to be taken. First of all, one of the things that - we're responsible for  percent of all the pollution in the country. He's right about how it affects people and it affects neighborhoods, particularly poor neighborhoods\n",
      "But here's the deal; in area, there's also another piece. Eighty-five percent of it is something I helped negotiate; and that is the Paris Climate Accord. I would immediately rejoin that Paris Accord. I would make sure that we up the ante which it calls for. I would be able to bring those leaders together who I know I - I convene them in the White House, like we did in nuclear summit, and I would raise the standard.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President\n",
      "BIDEN: I also invested $ billion -\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, sir.\n",
      "BIDEN: - in research for new alternatives to deal with climate change.\n",
      "BASH: Mr. Yang, your response?\n",
      "BIDEN: And that's bigger than any other person.\n",
      "YANG: The important number in Vice President Biden's remarks just now is that he United States was only  percent of global emissions. We like to act as if we're  percent, but the truth is even if we were to curb our emissions dramatically, the earth is still going to get warmer.\n",
      "And we can see it around it us this summer. The last four years have been the four warmest years in recorded history. This is going to be a tough truth, but we are too late. We are  years too late. We need to do everything we can to start moving the climate in the right direction, but we also need to start moving our people to higher ground.\n",
      "And the best way to do that is to put economic resources into your hands so you can protect yourself and your families.\n",

      "BASH: Go ahead, Governor.\n",
      "INSLEE: Thank you very much. Look, we have -- these deadlines are set by science. Mr. Vice President, your argument is not with me, it's with science. And unfortunately, your plan is just too late. The science tells us we have to get off coal in  years. Your plan does not do that. We have to have off of fossil fuels in our electrical grid in . Your plan simply does not do that.\n",
      "I've heard you say that we need a realistic plan. Here's what I believe...\n",
      "BIDEN: No, I didn't say that.\n",
      "INSLEE: Here's what I believe. I believe that survival is realistic, and that's the kind of plan we need. And that's the kind I have.\n",
      "BIDEN: My plan calls for , charging stations around the country so by  we're all electric vehicles. My plan calls for making sure that we have $ billion invested in technologies to learn how to contain what we're doing, creating  million new jobs.\n",
      "We will double offshore wind. We will end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil fuel. But we have to also engage the world while we're doing it. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time. [applause]\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?\n",
      "BIDEN: No, we would -- we would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either -- any fossil fuel.\n",

      "BASH: Thank you, sir.\n",
      "INSLEE: We cannot work it out. We cannot work this out. The time is up. Our house is on fire. We have to stop using coal in  years, and we need a president to do it or it won't get done. Get off coal. Save this country and the planet. That's what I'm for.\n",
      "BASH: Senator Harris, your response?\n",
      "HARRIS: I mean, I have to agree with Governor Inslee. And I'm going to just paraphrase one of your great sayings, Governor, which is we currently have a president in the White House who obviously does not understand the science. He's been pushing science fiction instead of science fact. The guy thinks that wind turbines cause cancer, but what in fact they cause is jobs.\n",
      "And the reality is that I would take any Democrat on this stage over the current president of the United States, who is rolling it back to our collective peril. We must have and adopt a Green New Deal. On day one as president...\n",

      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. I want to talk about that with Senator Gillibrand. You're a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, which includes the guarantee of a job with medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security for everyone in America. Explain how that's realistic.\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office. [applause]\n",
      "The second thing I'm going to do is I will reengage on global climate change. And I will not only sign the Paris global climate accords, but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis.\n",
      "The greatest threat to humanity is global climate change. I visited a family in Iowa who -- water spewed into her home, Fran Parr, it tossed her refrigerator upend, all the furniture was broken, all the dishes were broken, and mud was everywhere. That is the impact of severe weather right now on families' lives.\n",
      "And so the truth is, we need a robust solution. When John F. Kennedy said I want to put a man on the moon in the next  years, not because it's easy, but because it's hard, he knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation, our success, our ability to galvanize worldwide competition.\n",
      "He wanted to have a space race with Russia. Why not have a green energy race with China? Why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans? [applause]\n",
      "Why not rebuild our infrastructure? Why not actually invest in the green jobs? That's what the Green New Deal is about.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you.\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: Not only will I pass it, but I will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us. [applause]\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Senator. Congresswoman Gabbard, you are not a cosponsor of the Green New Deal. Please respond.\n",
      "GABBARD: Well, first of all, this is personal. If you can imagine, I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world. So for us growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue, it's a way of life. It's part of our culture. It's part of who we are.\n",
      "This is why, as a member of Congress, long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act. That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy, invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you, Congresswoman.\n",
      "Senator Booker, what's your response? Is the job guarantee in the Green New Deal realistic?\n",
      "BOOKER: I just want to take, first of all, a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee. It's one of the reasons why Greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field of the candidates on climate.\n",
      "INSLEE: Second, Cory. Second, but close. You're just close. [laughter]\n",
      "BOOKER: I'm -- hey, hey. I want to say very clearly -- thank you, man. Thank you. I'll try harder.\n",
      "Look, the reason why is because, first of all, this problem didn't start yesterday. Science didn't become a reality yesterday. This has been going on for years. There was another president that would not join an international accord. Then it was the Kyoto accords. I was mayor then.\n",
      "And I stood up in national leadership joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue. It must be the issue and the lens with which we view every issue. Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords. That is kindergarten. We have to go to far advances and make sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat.\n",
      "And, yes, the majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we're going to deal with this is if the United States leads.\n",

      "Mayor de Blasio, your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in New York City public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead. As you know, we're not far from Flint, Michigan, where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water. [applause]\n",
      "How can you assure the people of Flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: We have a huge problem, and it's decades old in New York. But here's what we've done about it. We've declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and all as the goal of our administration, and we're doing something about it.\n",
      "Lead poisoning has gone down  percent since , and we're going to literally bring it down to zero, because we're going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all, and that needs to be done all over this country.\n",
      "Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing. For decades they've been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility. That's part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with.\n",
      "But I'll tell you what you do when you're actually in charge of something. I'm in charge of the largest city in this nation. You do not accept the status quo. You fix it. And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe, and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all. And there should be a federal mandate to do the same for Flint, for Detroit, for every place in this country.\n",

      "CASTRO: Well, because people don't have to wonder what I would do; I've actually done it. I was secretary of housing and urban development when Flint had its water crisis. I went to Flint. We did what we could to help folks get water filters.\n",
      "And then we didn't stop there. We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children. A lot of Americans don't know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $ billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it. We can do it.

Mr. Yang, in poll after poll democratic voters are saying that having a nominee who can beat President Trump is more important to them than having a nominee who agrees with them on major issues. And right now, according to polls, they say the candidate who has the best chance of doing that, of beating President Trump is Vice President Biden. Why are they wrong?\n",
      "YANG: Well, I'm building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and conservatives, as well as democrats and progressives. I believe I'm the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump and as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind.\n",
      "What we have to do is we have to say look, there's record high GDP in stock market prices, you know what else they're at record high is? Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety. It's gotten so bad that American life expectancy had declined for the last three years.\n",

      "I'm speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in Flint, Michigan are still being left behind, still being poisoned by the water in their system because every single month we are spending $ billion on a continuing war in Afghanistan, $ billion every single month rather than ending that war, bringing our troops home, and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country.

You have all outlined plans, but you in particular, that could end up raising taxes. How can you guarantee that won't hurt the economy?\n",

Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that they're getting laid off by General Motors, or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States, or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can't provide for their families or pay the rent.\n",

How would you ensure that the United States is able to remain competitive against China on the world stage?\n",
      "GABBARD: By pushing for fair trade, not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that give away American jobs, and that threaten our environment. These are the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n",
      "I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law. This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country.\n",
      "What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment. These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy. [applause]\n",
      "BASH: So to be clear, Congresswoman, would you keep President Trump's tariffs on China in place?\n",
      "GABBARD: I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan, and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.\n",
      "BASH: Vice President Biden, would you rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, of course, President Trump withdrew from? Please respond.\n",
      "BIDEN: I'd renegotiate. We make up  percent of the world's economy. In order -- either China is going to write the rules of the road for the st century on trade or we are. We have to join with the  percent of the world that we had with us, and this time make sure that there's no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there.\n",
      "And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now, in the things that make them more competitive. That's what we have to do. Otherwise, they are going to write the rules of the road. We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them in check from abusing.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you. Thank you. Vice President Biden, just to be clear, would you or would you not rejoin the TPP, yes or no?\n",
      "BIDEN: I would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America, so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted. Otherwise, they're going to do exactly what they're doing, fill the vacuum and run the -- and run the table.\n",

It's just as dangerous as the old NAFTA. It's going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan. And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA.\n",
      "So, Vice President, I believe you're the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA. Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA and that what you will believe in, which is a lot of us hope for, is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again, not just multinational corporations.\n",

Farris from Flint, Michigan, has this question: \"Here in Detroit, our economy has seen firsthand how technology and automation can displace workers and create uncertainty around human job security. How would you balance these disruptions created by technology with the beneficial impact of technology on our economy?\n",
      "BENNET: Dana, this goes to the last question you asked, as well, which is, how are we going to remain competitive? It's not just about trade, which we were talking about earlier. It's about whether we're going to invest in this country anymore.\n",
      "Since , we have cut $ trillion worth of taxes. Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America. We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government. We've spent $. trillion in the Middle East. That's $ trillion or $ trillion that from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan, or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire. We've got to stop doing that.\n",
      "And we need to invest in America again. For the money that we've spent that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country. We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed. We could have fixed not just Flint, but every water system in this country.\n",

      "BENNET: We could have made Social Security solvent for my children.\n",

      "YANG: I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in start-ups and entrepreneurship. We have to do more at every step. And if you're a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home, but then when you seek a mentor or an investor, often they don't look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one.\n",
      "In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitive and abusive jobs and relationships around the country.

      "As a single father who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it cost.\n",
      "I support making sure that every single solitary person needing childcare get an $, tax credit now. That would put , women back to work, increase the GDP by almost / of  percent. It's the right thing to do if we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things, why can't we do it this way?\n",

      "Senator Harris, you have criticized President Trump for interfering with the Justice Department, and just last month you said if you were elected president, your Justice Department would, quote, \"have no choice and should go forward with obstruction of justice charges against former President Trump.\" Why is it OK for you to advocate for the Justice Department to prosecute somebody, but President Trump, not him?\n",
      "HARRIS: Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do. But, listen, look, we all watched his testimony. I've read the report. There are  clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president, and he needs to be held accountable. I have seen people go to prison for far less. [applause]\n",
      "And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the president of the United States. [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Booker, your response?\n",
      "BOOKER: My response is exactly that. I've read the report. I've read the redacted versions of the report. We have something that is astonishing going on in the United States of the America. We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world. He's acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold.\n",
      "And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage. I believe that we in the United States Congress should start impeachment proceedings immediately. And I'll tell you this...[applause]\n",
      "Debbie Stabenow now has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings, because he is now stonewalling Congress, not allowing -- subjecting himself to the checks and balances. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. The politics of this be dammed. When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is, is what will we have done? And I believe the Congress should do its job.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Booker, thank you very much. Secretary Castro, what's your response?\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, I agree. I was the first of the candidates to call on Congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are  different incidents that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings.\n",
      "As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute. However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far, that you're likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Secretary.\n",
      "Mayor de Blasio, I'm going to bring you in. What's your response?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: I think it's obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment. But I want to caution my fellow Democrats. While we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment.\n",
      "We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready -- and I ask people on this stage this question -- are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? That's something every American wants to know about. That's something they want answers to right now.\n",
      "So, yeah, move for impeachment, but don't forget to do the people's business and to stand up for working people, because that's how we're actually going to beat Donald Trump. The best impeachment is beating him in the election of . [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Mayor, thank you very much. Senator Bennet, how do you respond to this conversation?\n",
      "BENNET: I think, look, as we go forward here, we need to recognize a very practical reality, which is that we are four months -- we've got the August recess. Then we are four months away from the Iowa Caucuses. And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress.\n",
      "I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump. [applause]\n",
      "He has to be a single-term president. And we can't do anything that plays into our -- his hands. We were talking earlier about -- about climate up here. It's so important. Donald Trump should be the last climate denier that's ever in the White House.\n",
      "LEMON: Senator Bennet, thank you very much. Secretary Castro, please respond.\n",
      "BENNET: But we need to be smart about how we're running or we're going to give him a second term. We can't do it.\n",
      "LEMON: Secretary, please, your turn.\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we're articulating to the American people. We're going to continue to do that. We have an election coming up.\n",
      "At the same time, Senator, you know, I think that too many folks in the Senate and in the Congress have been spooked by . I believe that the times are different. And in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it.\n",
      "And what's going to happen in the fall of next year, of , if they don't impeach him, is he's going to say, \"You see? You see? The Democrats didn't go after me on impeachment, and you know why? Because I didn't do anything wrong.\" [applause]\n",
      "These folks that always investigate me, they're always trying to go after me. When it came down to it, they didn't go after me there because I didn't do anything wrong.\"\n",

      "LEMON: Senator Bennet, please respond. [applause]\n",
      "BENNET: I -- I don't disagree with that. You just said it better than I did. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time. It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that. And I'm glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition...\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, my brother can. He's here tonight.\n",
      "BENNET: Ah, that's what I was going to say. It's your brother that's given you that good feeling about the Congress. [laughter]\n",

      "DE BLASIO: Thank you. For the last three years, we've watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant. And why? So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else.\n",
      "We can't let them get away with it. If we're going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something. This has to be the party of labor unions. This has to be the party of universal healthcare. This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.\n",
      "And when we do that, Donald Trump right on cue will call us socialists. Well, here's what I'll say to him. Donald, you're the real socialist. The problem is, it's socialism for the rich. We, here in this country, we don't have to take that anymore. We can fight back.\n",
      "If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy, then go to taxthehell.com and join us, so we can build a country that puts working people first.\n",

      "BENNET: Thank you. Thank you very much.\n",
      "What I want to say to all of you tonight is, we have been here before as a country. We have faced challenges that we've -- we actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought, how hard they worked, how hard they organized, the votes they had to take, the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic, more fair, and more free.\n",
      "And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history, who doesn't believe in the rule of law, who doesn't believe in the independence of the judiciary, who doesn't believe that climate change is real.\n",
      "I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us, all of us, to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them, and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face, but the only way we're going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us and the divisive politics of the last  years behind us.\n",
      "We need to come together united against a broken Washington, make Donald Trump a one-term president, and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves. We have to do it for them.\n",

      "Think about this: Literally the survival of humanity on this planet and civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president. And we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us. And that includes making this the top priority of the next presidency.\n",
      "And I alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration not the first day, but every day. And if you share my view of the urgency of this matter, I hope you'll join me, because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests. And it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuel special interests. Because that is our salvation, what it depends upon.\n",
      "So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this: I am confident and optimistic tonight, even in the face of this difficulty, because I know we can build a clean energy economy, I know we can save our children and our grandchildren. I know that we can defeat climate change and we will defeat Donald Trump.\n",

      "I also know how to beat Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to the American people. I've taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan and Ohio and in Pennsylvania, and I'll go to all the places in this country. I will fight for your family. It doesn't matter who you are, it doesn't matter where you live, it doesn't matter who you love. Because that's my responsibility.\n",

      "So we need a president who's not afraid of the big challenges, of the big fights. There is no false choice. We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas or we don't need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters. You need someone who can do both. And that's who I am.\n",

      "Now, as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, we would have  minutes,  minutes before we were hit. And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say, \"Incoming missile. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.\"\n",
      "And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmonger's hoax. There is no shelter. It's all a lie.\n",
      "As president, I will end this insanity, because it doesn't have to be this way. I will end these wasteful regime change wars, work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to de-escalate these tensions and take the trillions of dollars that we've been wasting on these wars and on these weapons and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home, things like health care for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure.\n",

You and I, we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices, people that fought in wars and fought discrimination, folks that picked crops and stood in picket lines, and they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today.\n",

It was the fact that I wasn't wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away  million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we're up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show.\n",

They're hosting us today, and one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around and Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us or underestimate or worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause.\n",
      "That's the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy...[applause]...that was a UAW worker, my grandfather, who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundromat right here in this city.\n",
      "That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that. But the dream of this country is under threat right now. While, my mom's generation,  -- % of baby boomers did better than their parents. It's now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crisis in our country, and the crisis is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump.\n",
      "I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor and not the ceiling. The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him. He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room. It's when we start focusing on each other and understanding that our common bonds and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before. It's what's going to save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as president of the United States, not just uniting the Democratic Party but making sure that we put more \"indivisible\" back into this one nation under God.\n",

I've taken on the for-profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. I've preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children.\n",
      "And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House. [applause]\n",
      "And I'm going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this. By their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards.\n",
      "What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years. And let me tell you, we've got a long rap sheet. We're looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top  percent and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families. We've got a person who has put babies in cages and separated children from their parents. We have someone who passed a so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families.\n",
      "So we must defeat him and then, in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country. And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at : in the morning.

This is the most consequential election anyone of you, no matter how old or young you are, has ever, ever participated in.

Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way. The America we know will no longer exist.\n",

      "We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive.

      "At the end of the day, I'm not going to support any plan that rips away quality health care from individuals. This is an example of wish list economics.

That way, if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive, but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, we'll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option, and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off their insurance.\n",

Look, this is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look, in this country, if you have health coverage -- if you don't have health coverage, you're paying too much for care, and if you do have health coverage, you're paying too much for care.\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: When I am president, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law. But we've got a crisis on our hands. And it's not just a crisis of immigration; it's a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America.\n",

And now we have a president who could fix it in a month, because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my watch.\n",

But you haven't implemented the plans, us governors and mayors are the ones, we have to pick up all the pieces when suddenly the government's supposed to take over all these responsibilities, and there's no preparation, the details aren't worked. You can't just spring a plan on the world and expect it to succeed --\n",

      "O'ROURKE: Bernie was talking about some of the battleground states in which we compete -- there is a new battleground state, Texas and it has  electoral college votes. And the way that we put it in play was by going to each one of those  counties. No matter how red or rural, we did not write you off. No matter how blue, or urban -- we did not take you for granted.\n",
      "And we didn't trim our sails, either. We had the courage of our convictions, talking about universal health care, comprehensive immigration reform, and confronting the challenge of climate before it is too late. We brought everyone in...\n",

      "BULLOCK: Yeah, as the only one of the field of  that actually won a Trump state --  percent to  percent of my voters voted for Donald Trump -- I know that we do have to win back some of those places we lost and get those Trump voters back if we're ever going to win.\n",
      "But this isn't just a choice between the left and the center. It's not a choice just between sort of these wish list economics or thinking that we have to sacrifice our values to actually win. What folks want is a fair shot. The way I won, the way we can win is to actually focus on the economy and the democracy aren't working for most people.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Governor.\n",
      "BULLOCK: That's how I win. That's how we can take back the office.\n",
      "TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Senator Warren, you make it a point to say that you're a capitalist. Is that your way of convincing voters that you might be a safer choice than Senator Sanders?\n",
      "WARREN: No. It is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win. I took on giant banks, and I beat them. I took on Wall Street, and CEOs, and their lobbyists, and their lawyers, and I beat them. I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator, and I beat him.\n",
      "I remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected. But here's where we are.\n",
      "I get it. There is a lot at stake, and people are scared. But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else. And we can't ask other people to vote for a candidate we don't believe in.\n",

      "Look at the story of Detroit, this amazing city that we're in. This city is turning around because the government and the private sector are working well together. That has to be our model going forward.

      "I don't get it. [applause]\n",
      "Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption. It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat. And we need to have the courage to fight back against that. And until we're ready to do that, it's just more of the same.\n",

      "But I also believe we need to have solutions that are workable. Can you imagine if we tried to start Social Security now but said private pensions are illegal? That's the equivalent of what Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are proposing with health care. That's not a big idea. That's an idea that's dead on arrival. That will never happen. So why don't we actually talk about things, big ideas that we can get done? The stakes are too high.\n",

      "WARREN: He talks about solutions that are workable. We have tried the solution of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. And what have the private insurance companies done? They've sucked billions of dollars out of our health care system. They've made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms. Why? Not because they're trying to track your health care. They just want one more excuse to say no. Insurance companies do not have a God-given right to suck money out of our health care system.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Everyone wants to get elected. But my point is this: I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over , lies, that we'd better be very straightforward with the American people.\n",
      "And, no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No, I don't think we're going to do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see, which is lower costs for health care.\n",
      "Do I think that we're going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No, I don't think we're going to do that. So that's what I'm talking about.\n",

      "And I think how we win an election is to bring everyone with us. And, yes, I have won in a state every single time statewide. I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over  points. He just targeted Minnesota last week.

      "O'ROURKE: You know, I think a big part of leadership and showing our commitment to the American people is delivering on our commitments. As a member of Congress, when I learned that the El Paso V.A. had the worst wait times for mental health care in the country, meaning that care delayed functionally became care denied, and was related to the suicide epidemic, we made it our priority and we turned around the V.A. in El Paso.\n",
      "We took that lesson nationally and I worked with Republican and Democratic colleagues to expand medical health care to veterans, and we got it signed into law by the one person with whom I agree on almost nothing -- Donald Trump -- to show that, at the end of the day, we will put the American people first...\n",

      "Congressman Delaney, I'll start with you. You say the Green New Deal is about as realistic as Trump saying Mexico is going to pay for the wall. But scientists say we need essentially to eliminate fossil fuel pollution by  to avoid the most catastrophic consequences. Why isn't this sweeping plan to fight the climate crisis realistic?\n",
      "DELANEY: Well, first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate, like universal health care, guaranteed government jobs, and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do.\n",
      "My plan, which gets us to net zero by , which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids, will get us there. I put a price on carbon, take all the money, give it back to the American people in a dividend. That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis. It's the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress.\n",
      "I'm going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by fivefold, because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem. I'm going to create a market for something called direct air capture, which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere, because I don't think we'll get to net zero by  unless we have those things. I'm going to increase investment in renewables and I'm going to create something called the Climate Corps.\n",
      "That is a plan that's realistic. It's a bet on the U.S. private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to net zero by  for our kids.\n",

      "WARREN: So, climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world. It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create.\n",
      "So I've proposed putting $ trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it, so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about . million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest.\n",

      "I share the urgency of everyone up here. We have to recognize -- I mean, everyone's got good ideas. What we do in this country is no better than just a best practice, right? It's what we do here is a best practice and a template, but it's got to be done all over the world.\n",
      "So we've got to be building bridges right now with people like China, who were cheating on international agreements and stealing intellectual property. We need to work on that, but not with a tariff system. We need every country working together if we're going to really deal with climate change in a realistic way.\n",
      "BASH: Thank you. Senator Warren, your response?\n",
      "WARREN: Look, I put a real policy on the table to create . million new jobs in green manufacturing. There's going to be a $ trillion worldwide market for this.

      "RYAN: Well, if we get our act together, we won't have to worry about it. I -- my plan is to create a chief manufacturing officer so we could actually start making things in the United States again, that would pull the government, the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, work with the private sector, work with investors, emerging tech companies, to dominate the electric vehicle market.\n",
      "China dominates it now,  percent to  percent. I want us to dominate the battery market, make those here in the United States and cut the workers in on the deal. The charging stations, solar panels, same thing; China dominates  percent of the solar panel market.\n",

And you can go ask -- you can go ask Gabe Brown and Allen Williams, who actually make money off of regenerative agriculture. So we can move away...[applause]...from all the subsidies that we're giving the farmers. They haven't made a profit in five years. And we could start getting good food into our schools and into our communities. And that's going to drive health care down. That's another part of the health care conversation...\n",

So please don't tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry. And nothing happens unless we do that. [applause]\n",
      "Here is the bottom line. We've got to ask ourselves a simple question, \"What do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet?\" I say that is criminal activity that cannot be allowed to continue.\n",

We have got to be super aggressive if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable, so I don't disagree with Tim. What that means is we got to, A, take on the fossil fuel industry, B, it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, at a hell of a lot of good union jobs, as we do that. We got to transform our transportation ...\n",

      "BULLOCK: Who - oh, no, I - I think Democrats often, when they're saying, oh, these fossil fuel industries, these workers, those coal miner workers. Look, the world's changing. We got to make a change, but I think Democrats often sound like the people that, as Congressman Ryan would say, shower at the end of the day, that they're part of the problem. And far too many communities are being left behind, as we make this transition.\n",

      "SANDERS: Look, Steve, there ain't nobody in the Congress who's more strongly pro-worker than I am. So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition. All right. We can create what the Green New Deal is about. It's a bold idea. We can create millions of good-paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker. We are going to provide and make sure that those workers have a transition, new jobs, healthcare and education.\n",

Are we going to actually address climate change? Fire seasons are  days longer in the west now. Or are we going to give people a better shot at a better life?\n",

We don't have more than  years to get this right, and we won't meet that challenge with half-steps or half-measures or only half the country. We've got to bring everyone in. The people of Detroit and those that I listened to in Flint last week, they want the challenge. They want those jobs. They want to create the future for this country and the world.\n",
      "Those community college students that I met in Tucumcari, New Mexico understand that wind and solar jobs are the fastest-growing jobs in the country. And those farmers in Iowa say pay me for the environmental services of planting cover crops and keeping more land in conservation easements. That's how we meet the challenge. We do it with everyone in this country. We bring everyone in to the solution.\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: We have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate, if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump. Nominate me, and you get to see the president of the United States stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was chance to serve.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Thank you Dana, and I was just in Flint. And they are still drinking bottled water in that town and that is outrageous. So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue. It's a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams.\n",
      "I think the Governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, \"fix the damn roads,\" and it is an issue for union jobs. And so I think what we need to do is not have a president that's promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers. And then he hasn't followed through -- he has done nothing, he blew up a meeting at the White House.\n",
      "I would put $ trillion in to this, and I would pay for it by first of all changing the capital gains rate by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind, but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer as he promised.\n",
      "And I would take that money and put it in to rural broadband and green infrastructure so you won't have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood -- that was African-American neighborhood that was most-hit when you had those recent rainstorms.\n",

      "WILLIAMSON: My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg. I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina where it is -- there is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint.\n",
      "We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act. We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice.\n",
      "I assure you, I lived Grosse Pointe -- what happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe. This is part of the dark underbelly of American society. The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight -- if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.\n",
      "We need to say it like it is, it's bigger than Flint -- it's all over this country, it's particularly people of color -- it's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back. And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're there for us and if those people don't feel it, they won't vote for us, and Donald Trump will win.\n",

How do you convince primary voters that you'd be the best nominee to take on President Trump and heal the racial divide in America?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: We'll call his racism out for what it is, and also talk about its consequences. It doesn't just offend our sensibilities to hear him say \"send her back,\" about a member of Congress, because she's a woman color, because she's a Muslim-American doesn't just offend our sensibilities when he calls Mexican immigrants \"rapists and criminals,\" or seeks to ban all Muslims from the shores of a country that's comprised of people from the world over, from every tradition of faith.\n",
      "It is also changing this country. Hate crimes are in the rise -- every single one of the last three years, on the day that he signed his executive order attempting to ban Muslim travel, the mosque in Victoria, Texas was burned to the ground.\n",
      "So we must not only stand up against Donald Trump and defeat him in this next election, but we must also ensure that we don't just tolerate or respect our differences, but we embrace them. That's what we've learned in El Passo, Texas -- my hometown. One of the safest cities in the United States of America, not despite, but because it's a city of immigrants and asylum seekers, and refugees.\n",
      "We will show that our diversity --\n",

      "LEMON: Congressman O'Rourke, thank you very much. Governor Hickenlooper, why are you the best nominee to heal the racial divide in America, please respond.\n",
      "HICKENLOOPER: Well the core value behind this entire country's history is working towards a more perfect union, that all people are created equal. And we've fallen far away from that. I think the job is incumbent on any one of us to make the convincing case that we can deliver an urban agenda that represents progress in schools.\n",
      "In Colorado when I was Mayor we got universal pre-K for every kid in the urban city. We did major police reform  years before Ferguson -- why is it now that five years after Ferguson we still don't have anything?\n",
      "How do we get affordable housing? We created a scholarship fund for every kid -- you've got to deliver a vision like that for the whole country.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you Governor. Senator Warren, I'm coming to you now. Last week the FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the majority of domestic terrorism cases this year have been motivated by white supremacy. In fact, the alleged shooter in this weekend's attack in Gilroy, California referenced a well-known white supremacist book on social media. How are you going to combat the rise of white supremacy?\n",
      "WARREN: We need to call out white supremacy for what it is: domestic terrorism. And it poses a threat to the United States of America. [applause]\n",
      "We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, health care racism. The way we do better is to fight back and show something better.\n",
      "So I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids, but we've got to acknowledge what's happened on race. So my plan has universal, tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grants and levels the playing field by putting $ billion into historically black colleges and universities.

      "BUTTIGIEG: As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me. I'm not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch.\n",
      "But in our city, we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges, like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing and so we directed it to a historically underinvested African-American neighborhood.\n",
      "Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use of force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters.\n",
      "I've proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally, because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action.\n",
      "Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health to homeownership. If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously. If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that aren't racist; they just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so I would appeal to them.\n",
      "But I don't think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV, and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop.\n",
      "The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education, and we pay teachers more, and we make sure there's a decent retirement system in place, yes, we help the African-American community and we must, because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what we've seen in the last decades, but we help everyone.\n",
      "So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone.\n",

      "Congressman O'Rourke, please respond.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: I want to acknowledge something that we're all touching on, which is the very foundation of this country, the wealth that we have built, the way we became the greatest country on the face of the planet was literally on the backs of those who were kidnapped and brought here by force.

I will focus on education, address health care disparities, but I will also sign into law Sheila Jackson Lee's reparations bill so that we can have the national conversation we've waited too long in this country to have. [applause]\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke. Speaking of reparations, Ms. Williamson, many of your opponents support a commission to study the issue of reparations for slavery. But you are calling for up to $ billion in financial assistance. What makes you qualified to determine how much is owed in reparations?\n",
      "WILLIAMSON: Well, first of all, it's not $ billion in financial assistance. It's $ billion, $ billion to $ billion payment of a debt that is owed. That is what reparations is. [applause]\n",
      "We need some deep truth-telling when it comes. We don't need another commission to look at evidence. I appreciate what Congressman O'Rourke has said. It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal.\n",
      "All that a country is, is a collection of people. People heal when there's some deep truth-telling. We need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with. [applause]\n",
      "That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was  years of slavery followed by another hundred years of domestic terrorism.\n",
      "What makes me qualified to say $ billion to $ billion? I'll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the  acres and a mule, given that there was  million to  million slaves at the end of the Civil War, four to five -- and they were all promised  acres and a mule for every family of four, if you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than $ billion is an insult.\n",
      "And I believe that $ billion to $ billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface, an emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal.\n",

      "SANDERS: Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburn's legislation, which is called --. And what that understands is that as a result of slavery, and segregation, and the institutional racism we see now in health care, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities.\n",
      "In terms of education, I also have a plan. It's called the Thurgood Marshall Plan. And it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for Title I schools. It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $, a year. [applause]\n",

      "Congressman Ryan, President Trump's tariffs have boosted the U.S. steel industry but hurt auto manufacturers like those here in Michigan, which could drive up the cost of cars. As president, would you continue President Trump's steel tariffs?\n",
      "RYAN: Look, I think President Trump was onto something when he talked about China. China has been abusing the economic system for a long time. They steal intellectual property. They subsidize goods coming into this country. They've displaced steel workers, auto workers, across the board, eroded our manufacturing. And we basically transferred our wealth of our middle class either up to the top  percent or to China for them to build their military.\n",
      "So I think we need some targeted response against China. But you know how you beat China? You out-compete 'em. And that's why I'd put a chief manufacturing officer in place to make sure that we rebuild the manufacturing base.\n",
      "We've got to fill these factories that -- in Detroit, in Youngstown, that used to make cars and steel. We've got to fill them with workers who are making electric vehicles, batteries, charging stations, make sure they're making solar panels.\n",
      "As I said earlier, China dominates  percent of the solar panel market. They dominate  percent to  percent of the electric vehicle market. We're going to make  million electric vehicle somewhere in the world in the next  years. I want them made in the United States. That's why I have a chief manufacturing officer that will sit in the White House and help drive this agenda.\n",
      "LEMON: Congressman, thank you. Just as a point of clarification, as president, would you consider President Trump's steel tariffs, yes or no?\n",
      "RYAN: Well, I would have to re-evaluate. I think some of them are effective. But he's bungled the whole thing, obviously. He has -- see, here's the problem with President Trump. He has a tactical move -- one of many -- he has a tactical move. What's the grand strategy for the United States? China has -year plan, a -year plan, a -year plan, a -year plan. We live in a -hour news cycle. That spells disaster for our economy and disaster for our global politics.\n",
      "LEMON: Thank you, Congressman. Congressman Delaney, your response? [applause]\n",
      "DELANEY: So, listen. This is what I don't understand. President Trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants. Most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on President Obama. I'm the only one running for president who actually supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama was right about that. We should be getting back in that.\n",
      "Senator Warren just issued a trade plan...\n",
      "WARREN: You bet I did.\n",

They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, they'll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam, they'll do it in a heartbeat.\n",
      "I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says we're not going to do it that way. We're going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table, with human rights activists at the table. And then, we're going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to America's markets. They want to sell to you...\n",

They constitute the largest tax increase on the American consumer, hitting the middle class and the working poor especially hard, and farmers in Iowa and across the country are bearing the brunt of the consequences.\n",
      "When have we ever gone to war, including a trade war, without allies and friends and partners?

      "Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right. If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, you're mistaken. If they can save five cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or anyplace else, that's exactly what they will do.\n",
      "As president, let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal trough. They want military contracts. They want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration, you ain't going to get those contracts if you're throwing American workers out on the street.\n",

      "WARREN: I'd like a chance to respond.\n",
      "HICKENLOOPER: So -- so I think -- again, I think Congressman Delaney has got a point here. And there is a way of looking at trade that is therapeutic.\n",
      "The bottom line is, you talk to any economist, there is not a single example in history where a trade war had a winner. Trade wars are for losers. And the bottom line is we've got to recognize, let's negotiate a better trade deal. But you're not going to win against China in a trade war when they've got  percent of our total debt.\n",
      "And step back and look it. Here's Trump gives a giant tax cut and at the same time -- so we're paying in tariffs about $ to $, per household and then we give this incredible tax cut to the rich. Essentially what's happening is now he's transferred that tax obligation onto the middle class. That's what's outrageous. But tariffs are not the solution.\n",
      "LEMON: Governor, thank you. Senator Warren?\n",
      "WARREN: Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the new NAFTA .. What's the central feature? It's to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits.\n",
      "That's what trade deals have become. They have become a way for giant multinationals to change the regulatory environment so they can suck more profits out for themselves and to leave the American people behind. We have to have the courage to fight back against that corruption.\n",

      "BULLOCK: You know, a farmer in Rippy said to me, every time that Trump tweets, we lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. If Montana had to eat all the wheat that we produce, every Montanan would have to eat  loaves of bread a day.\n",
      "But by the same token, what we have is -- I actually agree with Senator Warren on this in part. Corporations can move capital easy. Workers can't move. So going forward, we need to make sure that our trade deals actually are protecting -- thinking about the workers. They can't be the stepchild. But the way to do it, with this blunt instrument of tariffs that the president is doing, that's not how we get a fair deal for farmers anywhere or the manufacturers here in Detroit.\n",

The moment I redeployed, my Facebook add feed started filling with ads from these for-profit colleges. Under President Obama, they were held accountable for whether they delivered results. President Trump, under a secretary of education who regrettably is from this state, did away with those rules. There's no accountability.\n",

We had a $ trillion tax cut, where  cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us, that does not stimulate the economy.\n",

But unlike some of the other candidates on the stage, that's not just for tuition. That is room and books and board, the full cost of being able to better yourself so that you can better this country, and then for that schoolteacher who, in many places like Texas, is working a second or a third job, full forgiveness for her outstanding student loan debt, forgiveness for that person willing to work at the V.A. and serve our former service members.\n",

He goes to the demilitarized zone with the leader of North Korea, gives him a huge photo op, gives him global credibility, because the most powerful person in the world is sitting there meeting with him, and weeks later, he's lobbing more missiles. That doesn't make any sense.\n",

We need some radical truth-telling, not just to talk about health care, but talk about why are we so sick all the time. We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed.\n",
      "Even on the subject of foreign policy, it's all about symptoms and not about cause. We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership. The fact that countries see us, not only domestically but internationally, with policies that simply support our corporate overlords. The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace-building.\n",

Recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors as you were speaking about the problem of income inequality in this country you said we shouldn't quote demonize the rich. You said nobody has to be punished, no one's standard of living would change, nothing would fundamentally change. What did you mean by that?\n",

      "My dad used to have an expression he said Joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity, it's about respect, it's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything's going to be okay. Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.\n",
      "What I am saying is that we've got to be straightforward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we [inaudible] situation where there's continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is—is—is clean and they—they have water that they can drink.\n",

      "HARRIS: Well, let me tell you something. I—I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that—that benefits the top  percent and—[applause]—the biggest corporations in the—this country, contributing at least a—$ trillion to the debt of America, which middle-class families will pay for one way or another. Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly this economy is not working or working people.\n",
      "For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most, which why I am proposing that we change the tax code so, for every family that is making less than $, year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect, up to $ a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and was support or not. And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top  percent and the biggest corporations in America. [applause]\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Senator Harris, thank you. Governor Hickenlooper, let me get you in on this. You've warned that Democrats will lose in  if they embrace socialism, as you put it. You were booed at the California Democratic Convention when you said that. Only one candidate on this stage, Senator Sanders, identifies himself as a democratic socialist. What are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards socialism?\n",
      "HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don't clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and—and call us socialists. And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change, I'm a scientist, but we can't promise every American a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage. I believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege, but you can't expect to eliminate private insurance for  million people, many of whom don't want to give it up.\n",
      "In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together. We got to near universal healthcare coverage. We were the first state in America to—to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address, aggressively address methane emissions. And we were also the first place to—to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by  percent. We've done the big progressive things people said it couldn't be done. I've done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.\n",

      "SANDERS: Well, I think the responses at the polls, last poll I saw had us  points ahead of Donald Trump, because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and then he lied to the American people during his campaign. He said he was going to stand up for working families. Well, President Trump, you're not standing up for working families when you try to throw  million people off the healthcare that they have and that  percent of your tax benefits go to the top  percent. That's how we be Trump. We expose him for the fraud that he is. [applause]\n",

The debate we're having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there's a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other. And so, all the things that we're trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people.\n",

One hundred and sixty thousand families in the top . percent have the same wealth as the bottom  percent, and we got the worst income inequality that we've had in  years.\n",

I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having Medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance. I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: Sure. So, college affordability is personal for us. Chasten and I have six figure student debt. I believe in reducing student debt. It's logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier. [applause]\n",
      "I just don't believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires. I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition. And while I want — want tuition costs to go down I don't think we can buy down every last penny for that. Now, there's something else that doesn't get talked about in the college affordability debate. Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college. It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college. You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your children—[applause] [inaudible] little league whether you went to college or not.

      "YANG: I'm sorry?\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Oh, so it's difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion dollar tech companies paying literally  in taxes while they're closing  percent of our stores. Now, we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all of these innovations in other parts of the economy. And if we had a value added tax at even half the European level it would generate over  billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people, families and communities up we would spend the money and circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods—creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier. We'd save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $ billion. This is the move we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American's jobs, why Donald Trump is our president today that we automated away  million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and we're about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs on and on throughout the economy.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: So, I get to understand you a little better. So, you're saying $, a month for everyone over  but a value added tax so you can spend that $ on value added tax?\n",
      "YANG: Well, the value added tax what it would end up—you would still be increasing the buying power of the bottom  percent of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $, a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults it would $ to $, a year.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: OK. So, Congressman Swalwell, want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it—many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs. What would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?\n",

      "SWALWELL: —Displaces. And I've seen the anxiety across America where the manufacturing floors go from , to  to one. So, we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it. Invest in America's communities, especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills. But, Jose, I was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. That candidate was then Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of Americans  years ago. [applause]\n",

If we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Vice president, would you like to sing a torch song?\n",
      "BIDEN: I would. [laughter]\n",
      "I'm still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education. The fact is that that's why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. That's why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That's why I think we should have universal Pre-K. That's why I think every single person who graduates from high school— out of  now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they're making less than $, a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on.\n",
      "And so, folks, there's a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the st century. We're not doing that now.\n",

You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy. My great economy. You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working.

      "HOLT: Go ahead.\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: So, this is a very important issue. So, the plan that Senator Sanders and I and other support Medicare for All is how you get to single payer, but it has a buy in transition period, which is really important. In  when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All and I won that two to one republican district twice. And the way I formulated it was simple. Anyone who doesn't have access to insurance they like, they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford.\n",
      "So, that's what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All Plan. I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right, not a privilege to single payer. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers if they want to compete, they can certainly try. But, they'd never put people over their profits and I doubt they ever will.\n",
      "So, what will happen is people will choose Medicare. You will transition. We would get to Medicare for All. And then your step to single payer is so short. I would make it an earned benefit just like Social Security, so that you buy in your whole life. It is always there for you and it's permanent and it's universal.\n",
      "HOLT: Senator, your time is up. I want to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, we've taught look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you're actually supposed to get from here to there. [applause]\n",
      "Now here's how I would do it. It's very similar. I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. you take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges it. People can buy in. and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment.\n",
      "But, let's remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there there's still a private sector, that's fine. It's just that for our primary care we can't be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system. This one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced.

I couldn't imagine what it'd be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately. And then when my son came home from Iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live. I can't fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said by the way the last six months of your life you're on your own. We're cutting off. You've used up your time.\n",

Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance or no insurance, they, in fact, can buy into the exchange to a Medicare like plan.

If politicians can't make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level. How does this work?\n",

The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies. And, last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and I will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country, top ten companies made $ billion in profit.

      "WILLIAMSON: Well, first of all the government should never have made the deal with the big farm at that they couldn't negotiate; that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us. You know I wanted to say that while I agree with—I—I'm with Senator Bennet and others but I agree with almost everything here I will tell you one thing it's really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat Donald Trump by just having all of these plans you've got another thing coming because he didn't when by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying make America great again. We've got to get deeper than just the superficial fixes as important as they are. Even if we are just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we don't have a health care system in the United States, we have a sickness care system in the United States. We just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about who's going to pay for the treatment and how they are going to be treated. [applause]\n",

I had prostate cancer recently as you may know and that is why I was a little late getting in the race these same week my kid had her appendectomy out and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice. I think that is what the American people want. I believe it will get us there quickly. There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can't—they are too wealthy. Wealthy? They make too much money to be on Medicaid, they can't afford health insurance. When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single payer, there are  million people in Canada. There are  million people in the United States easily the number of people on a public option. It could easily be  million and for them it would be Medicare for all as mayor Buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it. And I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go. Also I will say Bernie is a very honest person. He has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for I guess that's where plastic surgery.

In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favor by having  million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare.\n",

If leadership consists of—of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House has divided us around a consensus issue. The American people want a pathway to citizenship. They wanted protections for Dreamers. We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country.

They're paying the Social Security tax. That's what they're doing. It's increase the lifespan. They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis.\n",
      "The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies.

And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people. A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that? I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says go back to where you came from. That is not reflective of our America and our values and it has got to end. [applause]\n",

      "HICKENLOOPER: Certainly the images we've seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by. If you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption—in Colorado we call that kidnapping. I—I would have called you— [applause]\n",
      "I would have told you it was unbelievable. And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil-facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families. The children are with their families. We have to make sure that—that ICE is completely reformed. And they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border. And we have to make sure, ultimately, that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing and access to medical care.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Ms. Williamson.\n",
      "WILLIAMSON: Yes, what Donald Trump has done to these children and it's not just in Colorado, Governor, you're right—it is kidnapping. And it's extremely important for us to realize that. If you forcibly take a child from their parents arms you are kidnapping them. And if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them that's called child abuse. This is collective child abuse.\n",
      "WILLIAMSON: This is collective child abuse. [applause]\n",
      "And when this is crime—both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesn't make it less of a crime. These are state-sponsored crimes. And what President—and what President Trump has done is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of America's moral core. We open our hearts to the stranger.\n",
      "This is extremely important and it's also important for all of us remember and I have great respect for everyone who is on this—on this—on this stage but we are going to talk about what to do about healthcare. Well, where have you been guys? Because if it's not just the matter of a plan and I haven't heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American foreign policy in Latin America and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Senator Gillibrand what would you do as President with a reality?\n",
      "GILLIBRAND: Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he has done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. When he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died in his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so I would do a few things. First, I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum-seekers at the border. I would have a community-based treatment center where you are doing it within the communities where asylum-seekers are given lawyers, where there is real immigration judges, not employees of the Atty. Gen. but appointed for life and have a community-based system. I would fund borders security but the worst thing President Trump has done is he has diverted the funds away from cross-border terrorism, cross-border human trafficking, drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he is given that money to the for-profit prisons. I would not be spending money in for profit prisons—\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: We had—\n",

      "DIAZ-BALART: We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border. If—if you would be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation? Can we keep the hands up so we can see them?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Let's remember that's not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that it is no longer possible. Of course it wouldn't be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong. We have got to talk about one other thing because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now our party doesn't talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion. But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with Christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.

      "BIDEN: Look—\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents?\n",
      "BIDEN: The first thing I would do is unite families. I would surge immediately billions of dollars' worth of help to the region the immediately. Look, I talk about foreign policy. I am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term to spend $ million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was updated and along came this President and he said he immediately discontinued that. We all talk about these things, I did it. I did it. [applause]\n",
      "—now look, second thing—second thing we have to do, the law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents.

To compare him to what—what this guy is doing is absolutely, I find—[applause]—close to immoral. But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place.

But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California. I led the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of  million people.\n",
      "And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who, by ICE's own definition, were non-criminals. So, as Attorney General and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community. Because what I saw—and I was tracking it every day. I was tracking it and saw that—that parents, people who had not committed a crime even by ICE's own definition, were being deported.\n",

And for Donald Trump to be doing what he's doing to children and their families at the borders I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in  that created a pathway to citizenship for  million people in this country that had the most progressive DREAM Act that's ever been conceived, much less passed, it got  votes in the Senate, that had $ billion of border security in it that was sophisticated st century border security, not a medieval wall that the president has—\n",

      "YANG: Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they've been hacking our democracy successfully. They've been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.\n",
      "Now, China, they do—they do [inaudible] property. It's a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides. I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that's now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or—or people in China. It's been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void.\n",
      "So, we need to—to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.\n",

      "BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, I mean first of all, we've got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing. They're using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But, their fundamental economic model isn't gonna change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren't in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes. And Americans are gonna pay on average $ more a year because of these tariffs. Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence.\n",
      "And this president is fixated on the China relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. We've got a much bigger issue on our hands. But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions.

We are hearing from  more tonight. Breakdown for each night was selected at random candidates will have  seconds to answer direct questions,  seconds for follow-ups if necessary.\n",

      "Over the course of the next hour we will hear from all of these candidates. We are going to begin this hour with Mayor Buttigieg. In the last five years civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system. Your community of South Bend, Indiana has recently been in uproar over an officer involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now  percent black in a city that is  percent black. Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: Because I couldn't get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting. A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer. And I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer says he was attacked with a knife, but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess. And we're hurting. And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community—all of the steps that we took from bias training to de-escalation but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes I have to face the fact and nothing that I say will bring him back. This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from what has happened in the past but what's happening around the country in the present. It threatens the well being of every community. And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing. A feeling not of fear but of safety. I'm determined to bring that day about.\n",

      "MADDOW: Governor, I'll give you  seconds.\n",
      "HICKENLOOPER: I think that the question they are asking in South Bend I think across the country is why is it taking so long? We had a shooting when I first became mayor  years before Ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent monitor—civilian oversight commission. We diversified the police force in two years. We actually did de-escalation training. I think the real question that America should be asking is why five years after Ferguson every city doesn't have this level of police accountability?\n",
      "MADDOW: Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.\n",
      "HICKENLOOPER: We—\n",
      "BUTTIGIEG: I've got to respond to that. Look, we've taken so many steps toward police accountability that the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. We're obviously not there yet. And I accept responsibility for that—\n",

      "WILLIAMSON: All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics, there are symptoms. And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice. Both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system. And the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. [applause]\n",

I—there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination. Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she—because we were black. And I will say also that—that in this campaign, we've also heard—and I'm going to now direct this to Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.\n",

And I—I was actually very—it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose bussing. And you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me. So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a—a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on. [applause]\n",

Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I'm happy to do that. I was a public defender. I didn't become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact — [applause] — when in fact — [applause] — when in fact my city was in flames because of the—the assassination of Dr. King, number one. Now, number two, as the U.S.—as—excuse me—as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way. The fact is that in terms of bussing, the bussing, I never—you would've been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. That's fine. That's one of the things I argued for that we should not be—we should be breaking down these lines.\n",

You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate's race or age or sexual orientation. Any Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues. Are you telling Democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision?\n",
      "SANDERS: No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about. But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB—L—LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made  years ago and that in the last  years the top  percent has seen a $ trillion increase in their wealth. We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.\n",

I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can't take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.\n",

On the issue of partisan gridlock President Obama promised in  that after his reelection Republicans would want to work with Democrats, fever would break. That did not happen. Now Vice President Biden is saying the same thing that if he is elected in  both parties will want to work together. Should voters believe that somehow if there is a Democratic President in  that gridlock is going to magically disappear?\n",
      "BENNET: Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first. [applause]\n",
      "Second, second, that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all  states but to—but to win the Senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare X so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington DC. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views.\n",
      "We need to in gerrymandering in wash—and we need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.\n",

      "BIDEN: I have seen what happened just sense we were vice president. We needed three votes to pass an $ billion recovery act that kept us from going into depression. I got three votes changed. We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $ billion by raising the top rate. And as recently as after the President got elected, I was able to put together a coalition on the Cures Act that billions of dollars go into cancer research, bipartisan.\n",

The Democratic Party had been running against that for  years. We've lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester. That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell.\n",

Now that there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, several Republican controlled state have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion. One of those laws could very well make it to the Supreme Court during your presidency if you're elected president. What is your plan if row is struck down in the court while your president?\n",

And I—and I want to talk directly-directly to America's women and to men who love them—women's reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican party. Thirty states are trying to overturn Roe v. Wade right now. And it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in  among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense. But let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption of the deal making—when the door is closed negotiations are made. There are conversations about women's rights and compromises have been made behind our backs. That's how we got to Hyde. That's how the Hyde Amendment was created. A compromise by leaders of both parties. Then we have the ACA.

I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning. And on this issue it is a—it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now. That is why I support a Green New Deal.

Any Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues. Are you telling Democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision?\n",
      "SANDERS: No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party we encourage diverse city, we believe in diverse city, that is what America is up about. But in addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the GB—L—LGBT community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made  years ago and that in the last  years the top  percent has seen a $ trillion increase in their wealth. We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.\n",

I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism, we can't take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.\n",

Obama promised in  that after his reelection Republicans would want to work with Democrats, fever would break. That did not happen. Now Vice President Biden is saying the same thing that if he is elected in  both parties will want to work together.

They would all leave  million assault in our communities. They wouldn't do a single thing to save a single life in Parkland. I will approach this issue as a prosecutor. I will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks—but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they're wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later.

      "GUTHRIE: Ms. Williamson,  seconds for your closing statement.\n",
      "WILLIAMSON: I'm sorry we haven't talked more tonight about how we are going to beat Donald Trump. I have an idea about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk. He's not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans. He is going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea what this man has done. This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and he has harnessed fear for political purposes. So, Mr. President, if you're listening, I want you to hear me please—you have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out. So, I sir, I have a feeling you know what you're doing. I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field and, sir, love will win. [applause]\n",

My mom and her parents came to the United States to rebuild their shattered lives —in the only country that they could,  years before that my parents family came searching religious freedom here. The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools. That's why I'm running for president. I've had two tough races in Colorado by bringing people together not by making empty promises. And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump and the corruption in Washington and build a new era of—of American democracy and American opportunity.\n",

      "HICKENLOOPER: I'm a small business owner who brought that same scrappy spirit to big Colorado, one of the most progressive states in America. We've expanded reproductive health to—to reduce teenage abortion by  percent. We were the first state to legalize marijuana and we transformed our justice system in the process. We passed universal background checks in a purple state. We got to near universal healthcare coverage. We attack climate change with the toughest methane regulations in the country. And for the last three years, we've been the number one economy in America.\n",
      "You don't need big government to do big things. I know that because I'm the one person up here who's actually done the big progressive things everyone else is talking about. If we turn towards socialism, we run the risk of helping to reelect the worst president in American history.\n",

But, our rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v. Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them. As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will. I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell. I've stood up to the banks and voted against the bail out twice. I've stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate. And I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly funded elections to deal with political corruption.\n",

Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee and that is who can beat Donald Trump in . That is the right question. And the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected and will have a vision of a trickle up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as Democrats and progressives. I am that candidate. I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward and that is where I'll take the country in .\n",

How come for the last  years wages have been stagnant for the middle class? How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty? How come  million people still have student debt West Denmark how can three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America? And here is the answer, nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military industrial complex in the fossil fuel industry. If we don't have the guts to take them on we will continue to have plans, we will continue to have talk and rich will get richer and everybody else will be struggling. [applause]\n",

      "WARREN: Thank you. It's good to be here.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: You have many plans free college, free childcare, government healthcare, cancellation of student debt, new taxes, new regulations, the breakup of major corporations but this comes at a time when  percent of Americans say the economy is doing well including  percent of Democrats. What do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?\n",
      "WARREN: So I think of it this way, who is this economy really working for? It's doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It's doing great for giant drug companies. This is not doing great for people are trying to get a prescription filled. It's doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons just not for the African-Americans and Latinx whose families are torn apart whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined. It's doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us. When you've got a government—when you've got an economy that does great for those with money and isn't doing great for everyone else that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it had on and we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Senator Klobuchar you have called programs like free college something you might do if you were quote a magic genie. To be blunt are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering giving your voters—people a false sense of what is actually achievable?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what is going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. So I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids; I do. But I think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister got their first agrees with community college. There's many paths to success as well as certifications. Secondly I would use programs. I would double them from $ to $, a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to $,. And then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because I can tell you this, if billionaires...\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Senator Klobuchar, [inaudible].\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: That's time, thank you. Congressman O'Rourke, what we have just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable. In that vein some Democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of  percent on the very highest earners, those making more than $ million a year. Would you support that? And if not, what would your top individual rate be?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: This economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn't and it's going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does. [untranslated) Right now we have a system that favors those that can pay for access and outcomes, that is how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest. A $ trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality. A new democracy that is revised because we have returned power to the people, no pacts, no gerrymandering, automatic and same-day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Congressman O'Rourke.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: That's how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Congressman, that—that's time, sir.\n",
      "I'll give you ten seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question would you support a  percent individual marginal tax rate, yes, no or pass?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: I would support a—a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone. Tax capital at the same rate...\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Seventy percent?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: ...that you—you tax ordinary income. Take the corporate tax rate up to  percent. You would generate the revenues...\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Okay. That's time.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: ...you need to pay for the programs we are talking about.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: That is time. Thank you. Senator Booker there is a debate on this party right now about the role of corporations as you know. Senator Warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. You have said we should not go be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process. Why do you disagree?\n",
      "BOOKER: I don't think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. You see the evidence of that in how dignity is being strip from labor and we a people who work full-time jobs and still can't make a living wage. We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs and use see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that is hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete. One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. So I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work. And I will tell you this I live in a low-income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street's rankings is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: But quickly Senator Booker you did say that you didn't think it was right to name names, to name companies and single them out as Senator Warren has. Briefly, why is that?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, again I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. And when it comes to antitrust law what I would do is number one appoint judges that will enforce it; number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United in the way they are trying to influence Washington. It's about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: That's time, sir.\n",
      "BOOKER: We need to have someone that's champion for them.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Thank you, Senator. Senator. Warren, I mentioned you. Are you picking winners and losers?\n",
      "WARREN: So the way I understand this is there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country. That hurts workers, it hurts small businesses, it hurts independent farmers, it hurts our economy overall. And it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy. Now look, we've had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. What's been missing his courage. Courage in Washington to take on the giants. That's part of the corruption in the system. It has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding those super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return to government to the people, and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying I have the courage to go after them.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Thank you.\n",
      "HOLT: Secretary Castro, my—the next question is for you. Immigrants have been talking about the pay gap for decades. What would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country?\n",
      "CASTRO: Thank you very much for that question, Lester. You know, I grew up with a mother who raised her brother Joaquin and me as a single parent, and I know what it's like to struggle. I know what it's like to rent a home and to worry about whether you're going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom worked very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they're women. I would do several things starting with something we should have done a long time ago, which is to pass the equal rights amendment finally in this country. And also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. It's past time that we did that And you know, we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.\n",
      "HOLT: All right, thank you. I want to put the same question to Congresswoman Gabbard. Your thoughts on equal pay.\n",
      "GABBARD: Yeah, well first of all, let's recognize the—the situation we're that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful. That's not what we have right now. I enlisted in the Army National Guard after the Al Qaeda terror attacks on / so I could go after those who had attacked us on that day. I still serve as a Major. I served over  years, deployed twice in the Middle East, and in Congress, served on the foreign affairs and armed services committees for over six years. I know the importance of our national security as well as the terribly high cost of war. And for too long, our leaders have failed us taking us from one regime change war to the next leading us into a new Cold War an arms race, tossing us trillions of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives. This insanity must end. As president, I will take your hard-earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs, things like healthcare, a green economy, good paying jobs, protecting our environment, and so much more.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Mayor de Blasio, good evening. You're the mayor of the biggest city in the United States, but it's also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor. How would you address income inequality?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Well, we've been addressing incoming inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people, $ minimum wage, paid sick days, Pre-K for all, things that are making a huge difference in working people's lives. But let me tell you what we are hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear, this is supposed to be the party of working people. Yes, we're supposed to be for  perecent tax rate on the wealthy. Yes, we are supposed to be for free college, free public college for our young people, we are supposed to break up big corporations when they're not serving our democracy. This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive. And in New York, we've proven that we can do something very different. We can put money back in the hands of working people. And let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people and their communities, you hear folks say there's not enough money. What I say to them every single time is there's plenty of money in this world. There's plenty of money in this country. It's just in the wrong hands.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Thank you. Congressman...\n",
      "DE BLASIO: We Democrats have to fix that.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: ...Congressman Delaney, do you agree?\n",
      "DELANEY: I think we need to do real things to help American workers and the American people, right? This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage, and I've called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers. Then we've got to fix our public education system. It's not delivering the results our kid's needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that. You know, I'm very different than everyone else here on the stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small to midsize businesses all over the country. — of them I supported. The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities. I know how to create jobs. We need a short-term strategy, which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the in earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave, and then we need to have a long-term strategy to make sure this country is competitive, and we are creating jobs everywhere in this country.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Governor Inslee, how would you address income inequality?\n",
      "INSLEE: Well, I'm a little bit surprised. I think plans are great, but I am a governor and we got to realize that the people who brought us the weekend, unions, need—are going to bring us a long overdue race in America. And I'm proud of standing up for unions. I've got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally. I marched with the SCIU folks. It is not right that the CEO of McDonald's makes  times more than the people slinging hash at McDonald's. And the next thing I'll do is put people to work in the jobs of the president present in the future. Look it, Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs. And we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future. Carpenters, IBW's members, machinists, we're doing it in my state today. And then we can do what America always does, lead the world and invent the future and put people to Burke. That's what we're going to do. [inaudible]\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: So Congressman Ryan, President Trump, and you just refer to him, promised that manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of Ohio. Can—can you make that same promise?\n",
      "RYAN: Yes, I believe you can. But the first, let's say the president came, he said don't sell your house, the people in Youngstown Ohio. And—and his administration just in the last two years, we lost $— jobs out of General Motors facility. That rippled throughout our community. General Motors got a tax cut, General Motors got a bailout. And then they have the audacity to move a new car that they're going to produce to Mexico.\n",
      "I've had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor, put it in a box, and ship it to China. My area where I come from in Northeast Ohio, this issue we're talking about here, it's been going on  years. This is not a new phenomenon in the United States of America. The bottom  percent haven't seen a raise since . Meanwhile, the top  percent controlled  percent of the wealth. We need an industrial policy saying were going to dominate building electric vehicles, there's going to be  million navy made in the next  years. I want half of them made in the United States. I want to dominate the solar industry...\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Thank you\n",
      "RYAN: ...and manufacture those here in the United States.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Senator Warren. Are they coming back? Are these jobs coming back?\n",
      "WARREN: So we had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now and it's basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, they're going to do it. So here's what I propose for an industrial policy, start with a place where there's a real need. There's going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water, and we can be the ones to provide that. We need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward. And then we need to say —Any corporation can come and use that research. They can make all kinds of product from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America. And then we have to double down and sell it around the world. There is a $ trillion market coming for green products. We should be the leaders and the owners, and we should have that . million manufacturing jobs here in America.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Thank you.\n",
      "WARREN: We can do this.\n",
      "HOLT: All right. We're going to turn to the issue of healthcare right now. And really try to understand where there may or may not the daylight between you. Many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan? Just a show of hands to start off with. All right, well Senator Klobuchar, let me put the question to you. You are one of the Democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government healthcare plan. Why is it an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overall?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, I think it's a bold approach. It's something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act, and that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in a four years, which is exactly what this bill says. So, let me go on beyond that. There is a much bigger issue in addition to that, and that is pharmaceuticals. The president literally went on TV on Fox and said that people's heads would spend when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, , drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office. Instead, he gave $ billion in giveaways to the pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America, that's what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it. And so, my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries. And pharma thinks they own Washington. Well, they don't own me.\n",
      "HOLT: Your time is up. Thank you. Senator—Senator Warren, you signed on to Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan. It would put essentially everybody on the Medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage. Is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president?\n",
      "WARREN: So, yes, I'm with Bernie on Medicare for All, and let me tell you why. I've spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of healthcare, medical bills. And that's not just for people who don't have insurance. It's for people who have insurance. Look at the business model of an insurance company. It's to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising co-pays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for All solves that problem. And I understand there are a lot of politicians who say, oh, it's just not possible. We just can't do it. It's—have a lot of political reasons for this. What they're really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right, and I will fight for basic human rights.\n",
      "HOLT: Senator, thank you.\n",
      "WARREN: That means Medicare for All.\n",
      "HOLT: Congressman—Congressman O'Rourke, when you ran for Senate, you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance. This year, you're saying you're no longer sure. Can you explain why?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: My goal is to ensure that every American is well enough to live to their full potential because they have healthcare. In Laredo, Texas, I met a young man,  years old, told me that he'd been to a doctor once in his life. And on that visit, he was told he had diabetes, was told he had glaucoma, and he was told untreated, because he doesn't have healthcare, he'll be dead before the age of . So, getting to guaranteed, high quality, universal healthcare as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal; the ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider, the—the ability to see a mental health care provider. In Texas, the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today. And healthcare also has to mean that every woman can make our own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible. Our plan says that if you're uninsured, we enroll you in Medicare. If you're insufficiently in short, you can afford your premiums, we enroll you in Medicare. But if you're a member of a union that negotiated for a healthcare plan that you like because it works for you.\n",

      "DELANEY: A hundred million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way? It should be noted that a hundred million Americans—I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what's working and fixes what's broken. I mean, doesn't that make sense? I mean, we should give everyone in this country healthcare as a basic human right or free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand up for taking away something from the people? And also, it's bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. So, to some extent, were basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital close. I mean, my dad was a union electrician, right? I actually grew up in a working-class family. He loved the healthcare that the IBEW have him. And I'd just always think about my dad in anything I wouldn't do from a policy perspective. He'd look at me and—and he'd say good job, John, for getting healthcare for every American.\n",

      "GABBARD: I think we're talking about this in the wrong way. You're talking about one bill over another bill. Really, what we're talking about is our objective, making sure that every single American in this country is able to get the health care that they need. I believe Medicare for All is the way to do that. I also think that employers recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for All program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality healthcare that they need.\n",
      "HOLT: Senator.\n",
      "GABBARD: I also think if you—if you look at other countries in the world who have universal healthcare, every one of them has some form of a role of—of private insurance. I think that's what we've got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need regardless\n",

      "BOOKER: I absolutely will. First of all, we're talking about this as a healthcare issue. But in communities like mine, low income communities, it's an education issue because kids who don't have healthcare are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs —And employment because people that do not have good health care do not succeed at work. It's even a retirement issue because, in my community, African-Americans have a lower life expectancy because of the poorer health care. And so, where I stand is very clear. Healthcare is not just a human right, it should be an American right. And I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All. But I have an urgency about this. When I am president of the United States, I'm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. And on this debate, I'm sorry. There are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America from the—from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally, the overhead for insurers that they charge is  percent, while Medicare's overhead is only at  percent. We can do this better, and every single day I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable cost until we get to my goal.\n",

And the idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved. You could do it either way. At its—the estimates are  million people would see a reduction in their premiums,  more million people would get covered.

And, you know what that means is just because a woman or let's also not forget someone in the trans community—a trans female —is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose. So, I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion. More than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri and Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v Wade and will respect. And in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our healthcare system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.\n",

And, I want to add on that—it's not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. Forty-seven years ago Roe versus Wade was decided and we've all looked to the courts all that time.

Should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do?\n",
      "BOOKER: They should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible. This is one of the reasons why [inaudible] I was running for president I said I would not take contributions from former companies, not take contributions —I will not take contributions from corporate tax or pharma executives because they are part of this problem. And this opioid addiction in our country we in cities like mine have been seeing how we have been trying to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical that are responsible help to—help to pay for that.\n",

Many are there for non-violent drug crimes including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized. And despite what Purdue Pharma has done—their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we're seeing throughout this country they've been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences not a single night in jail. Unless there's accountability and justice this crisis will continue. In my administration we will hold them to account.

Even as close as Homestead, Florida, right here less than  miles from where we are tonight. Fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the United States of America. We saw that image today that broke our hearts and they had names. Oscar Martinez and his  month old daughter Valeria died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country. Last month, more than , migrants were apprehended at the Southern Border. Secretary Castro, if you were president today what would you specifically do?\n",
      "CASTRO: Thank you very much, Jose. I'm very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan and we saw those images —watching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria is heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off. If I were president—and it should spur us to action. If I were president I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump's zero tolerance policy, the remain in Mexico policy and the metering policy. This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river—river. They have been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at the ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim. So, they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: On day one, sorry. I [inaudible].\n",
      "CASTRO: On day one I would sign an executive order that would address metering and the in would follow that up in my first  days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims. That would put undocumented immig—undocumented immigrants as long as they haven't committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship and we get to the root cause of the issue which is—we need a marshal plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. So that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.\n",

When people come to their—this country they do not leave their human rights at the border. Number two, I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients and to make sure that people who are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here. And then finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the Northern Triangle. Not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and think that we are going to get border security. We actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both.\n",
      "CASTRO: If I might very briefly—and this is an important point. My plan and I'm glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren and Governor Inslee agree with me on this—my plan also includes getting red—getting rid of Section  of Immigration Nationality Act. To go back to the way we used to treat this—when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation. To treat that as a civil violation. And—and here is why it's important—we see all of this horrendous family separation they use that law Section  to justify under the law separating little children from their families.\n",

      "BOOKER: As my friend here said I agree with him on that issue but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn't just go on at our border. It happens in our communities. ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses and the like. And are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work. We must end those policies as well.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: [inaudible]— about immigration this country—because look at the bottom line here. Those tragic—that tragic photo of those that parent that child and I'm saying this as a father—every American should feel that in their heart. Every American should say those are not our values but we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system because we are not being honest about the division that has been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges. For all of the American citizens out there who feel you are falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you the immigrants didn't do that to you. The big corporations did that to you. The one person did that to you. We need to be a party of working people and that includes a party of immigrants but first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that we are going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people we are all in this together. If we don't change that debate, that politics that is holding us back we won't get all of these reforms that people are talking about. That is what we need to do as Democrats.\n",

      "O'ROURKE: we would not attain any family fleeing violence. In fact, fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today. We would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image. Free dreamers forever from in the fear of deportation by making them U.S. citizens here in this country.

      "DIAZ-BALART: I will give you thirty seconds.\n",
      "CASTRO: Let's be very clear. The reason that they are separating these little children from their families is that they are using section  of that Act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the pr—the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to in that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O'Rourke have not and I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that.

      "KLOBUCHAR: Immigrants, they do not diminish America. They are in America and I am happy to look at his proposal but I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law. What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that seventy of our Fortune five hundred companies are headed up by people that came from other countries, twenty-five percent of our U.S. Nobel Laureates were born in other countries. We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories, we need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants. And so my proposal is to look at that twenty thirteen bill that passed the Senate with Republican support to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible and get it done. It brings the debt down by $ billion dollars.\n",

      "RYAN: Well I—I agree with Secretary Castro. I think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they are dealing in drugs and other things. That is already established in the law. So there is no need to repeat it and I think it's a bore it we are talking about this father who got killed with his daughter and the issues here, the way these kids are being treated, if you go to Guantanamo Bay there are terrorists that are held that get better healthcare than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the United States. That needs to stop and I think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids. What kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the United States who is so focused on hate and fear and division and what has happened now they end result is now we've got kids literally laying in their own's not with three-week gold diapers that haven't been changed? We have got to tell this president that is not a sign up straight, Mister president.\n",

But note—a lot of people [inaudible] the question if you are president on day one what will you do with the fact that you will have families here? There's been a lot of talk about what you will do in the first one hundred days about legislation. What will you actually do with these families? How will you care for them? Will they be detained or will they not be?\n",
      "BOOKER: Well, this is a related and brief point because what we are talking about—what Secretary Castro and I are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private persons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and they are immigration lockups. Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things whether it's immigration, whether it's mental illness, whether it's addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem. Donald Trump is in solving this problem. We've seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place and we make sure we use our resources to provide healthcare, to affirm the values of human dignity that people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: All right, senator, thank you. Let me go to governor Inslee on this. What would you do on day one? Same question I just ask Cory Booker. I have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage. What will you do with the families that will be here?\n",
      "INSLEE: There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children. They should be released pending their hearings and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed. That is what should happen and we should do what we are doing in Washington state. I am proud that we have passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini ICE agents. I am proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trump's heinous Muslim band. I am proud to be a person who has not only talk to about dreamers but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state and I will leave you with this thought if you want to know what I think. Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me, he thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees in Washington state if we passed the law that I passed. And I told him, that's on a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity is a strength. This is how we built America. That tradition is going to continue if I'm president.\n",

      "DELANEY: Just—just one more.\n",
      "HOLT: We've got a lot to get through. Let's—let's\n",
      "DELANEY: On this. My grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country.\n",
      "HOLT: We need—we're going to—were going to talk about Iran right now because we're working against the clock. Takers have been attacked. A U.S. drone has been shut down. There have been disturbing threats issued by both the U.S. and Iranian leadership. I'd like you if you can just for a moment to put aside how you think we may have gotten here. But what I want to know is how do you dial it back? So a show of hands who as president would sign on to the  nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated. That's a—that's—well, Cory—Senator Booker, why not?\n",
      "BOOKER: May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we are seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of the deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and push back a nuclear breakout — years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled—being pulled in further and further into this crisis. We need to greet renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I'm not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I'm going to rejoin that deal because when I am president of the United States, I'm going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I'm going to do it.\n",
      "HOLT: All right. Senator Klobuchar, I'd like you to answer... [crosstalk]\n",
      "HOLT: That question because you've said - [crosstalk]\n",
      "HOLT: You would—you would negotiate yourself back into the Iranian agreement. Can you argue that that nuclear—nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and that's something we could negotiate to get back in the deal. But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians who claim now that they're going to blow the caps on enriching uranium and the Iranians have told us this. And so that's where we are right now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president. So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which was what he is done. And then finally, I would make sure that if there's any possibility of a conflict, and we're having this debate in Congress right now, that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that. And this president is literally every single day  minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war, and I don't think we should conduct foreign policy.\n",
      "HOLT: All right, your time is up.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: In our bathrobes at : in the morning.\n",
      "HOLT: Congresswoman...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: Which is what he does.\n",
      "HOLT: Congresswoman Gabbard You've said—you said you would—you would sign back on to the  deal. Would you—would you insist though that it address Iran's support for Hezbollah?\n",
      "GABBARD: Let's deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chicken hawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran. I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in , a war that took over  of my brothers and sisters in uniforms' lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives, it would exacerbate the refugee crisis, and it wouldn't be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war. This is why it's so important that everyone of us, every single American stand up and say no war with Iran. We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement And we need to negotiate how we can improve it. It was an imperfect deal. There are issues like their missile—their missile development that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war.\n",
      "HOLT: Your time is up. But I have just a very quick follow-up. What would your redline be that would—that—for military action against Iran?\n",
      "GABBARD: Look, obviously if there was an attack against the American—our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is, and it's important for us to recognize this, is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light up a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. That's why we need to disk de-escalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride, put the American people first.\n",

Obviously, because of the size of the field, not every person will be able to weigh in on everything. But over the course of this next hour, we will hear from everyone. I promise, everybody. And to begin with, we're going to go with guns. And Senator Warren, I want to start with you. We are less than  mile from Parkland, Florida where  people were killed in a school shooting last year, and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since. Many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban. But even if implemented, there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country. Should there be a role for the federal government?\n",

      "TODD: We're—we're—I apologize. You guys didn't get to hear this, the first part of the question. Obviously, where not far from Parkland, Florida. Gun activism has become a big part of high school life...\n",
      "WARREN: Yeah\n",
      "TODD: ...up there in Broward County. Many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions. Some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban. But even if it's put in place, there's still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns on the streets. Is there a role for the federal government in order—to play in order to get these guns off the streets?\n",

      "MADDOW: Never say that.\n",
      "TODD: Never say never. But we will—we will march forward here and I will lean forward here a little bit. Senator Warren, we're going to get to the gun question here. Parkland, Florida. It's just north of here in Broward County. As you know it has created a lot of teenage activism on—on the gun issue. It has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns including assault weapons ban. But even if you're able to implement that what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it?\n",
      "WARREN: So, in this period of time that I've been running for president I've had more than  town halls. I've taken more than  unfiltered questions and the single hardest question I've gotten—I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl—and that is to say, when you're President how are you going to keep us safe? That's our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence—children and teenagers. And they won't just die in mass shootings. They'll die on sidewalks. They'll die in playgrounds. They'll die in people's backyards. Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that. So what can we do? We can do the things that are sensible. We can do the universal background checks. We can ban the weapons of war. But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works. Where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe.\n",
      "TODD: OK.\n",
      "WARREN: We need to treat this like a virus that's killing our children.\n",
      "TODD: OK you didn't address do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there?\n",
      "WARREN: What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done.\n",
      "TODD: Ok.\n",
      "WARREN: You know, guns in the hands of a collector who has had them for decades who has never fired them...\n",
      "TODD: Right\n",
      "WARREN: ...who takes safety seriously that's very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly. We can't treat this as an across the board problem. We have to treat it like a public health emergency that means bring data to bare and it means make real change in this country.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you, Senator.\n",
      "WARREN: Whether it's politically popular or not.\n",
      "TODD: Senator Booker, you have a program.\n",
      "WARREN: Fight for our children.\n",
      "TODD: Senator Booker, you have a federal government buy back program in your plan. How is that going to work?\n",
      "BOOKER: First of all, I want to say my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But what's even worse is that I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I'm the only one I hope I'm the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew Shahad Smith was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency. And for those who have not been directly affected they're tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing and arithmetic and how to deal with an active shooter in their school. This is something that I'm tired of and I'm tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say faith without worse is dead so we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is we've let the—the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you, Senator Booker.\n",
      "MADDOW: Sir, I'd like to talk to you about something that Sen—Senator Booker just mentioned, the idea of active shooter drills in schools. As school shootings seem like an almost every day or every week occurrence now, they don't make a complete news cycle anymore, no matter the death toll. As parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this, next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings. Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes? Or, is there something that you would do as president that you really think about turn it around?\n",
      "CASTRO: You know, Rachel, I—I'm the dad of a  year old girl, Carina, who's here tonight and the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place that's supposed to be safe. The answer to your question is no, we don't have to accept that. And I believe that on January , , at : p.m., we're going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate. And —the activist of Parkland folks, from Moms to men who have risen up—risen up across the United States —and inspired so many people, you know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we're getting closer. The House took a vote, in the Senate. The question often is if it's—if a decision is between  votes, a filibuster, or passing common sense gun reform, I'm going to choose common sense gun reform. So, I believe that we're going to be able to get that done in .\n",

We need trauma based care in—in every school. We need social and emotional learning in every school. Ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they're in and  percent of them feel shamed, traumatized, or bullied. We need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school. That means a mental health counselor in every...\n",
      "UNKNOWN: Yeah\n",

      "TODD: Congressman O'Rourke, you're a Texan who's campaigned—you can't campaign all over the state in  in the most conservative parts there. What do you tell a gun owner who's—may agree with you on everything else, okay, but says, you know what? The Democrats, if I vote for them in there, they're going to take my gun away. And even though I agree with you on all these other issues, I got—how do you have that conversation?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Here's how we had that conversation in Texas. I shared with them what I learned from those students who survived the Santa Fe High School shooting. A young student named Bree, her friend Marcell, who survived another shooting, the mother of a victim who lost her life, Rhonda Heart. They talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole. We know that they save lives. Talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities. Those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible. They should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities. Red flag laws. So, if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else, they're stopped before it's too late. And what I found in each one of those  counties is that Democrats and independents and Republicans, gun owners and non-gun owners alike agreed, but this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue. Those students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas led the charge here in Florida and they've been able to change those laws. They're making our democracy work, ensuring that our values and our interests...\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Well, that's not confiscation.\n",
      "TODD: Right.\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: You would give them the offer to buy back their gun, but I'll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state? These proposals don't do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapon ban. When I was in the Senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed. And then now, these Parkland kids from Florida, they started a literally a national shift. You know why? It's just like with gay marriage. When kids talk to their parents...\n",
      "TODD: Yeah\n",

      "TODD: We got another issue.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Mitch McConnell says that his most consequential achievement as Senate majority leader was preventing President Obama from filling a Supreme Court seat. Having served with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee do you believe they would confirm your court nominees?\n",
      "BOOKER: I'm going to use  of my seconds just to say there's one thing we don't all agree with when it comes to guns and it's common sense and over  percent of Americans agree with me. If you need a license to drive a car you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that but in states like Connecticut that did that they saw  percent drops in gun violence and  percent drops in suicides. We need to start having old agendas on guns. When it comes to the Supreme Court very clearly we—I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro, we are going to get to  votes in the Senate. This is  [inaudible] whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina because we can elect Jamie Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa because we—we can win a Senate seat there. This is about getting us back to having  votes in the Senate and more so that we can not only balance the Supreme Court but start to pass an aggressive agenda that, frankly, isn't so aggressive because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.\n",
      "TODD: Mayor DeBlasio [inaudible].\n",
      "MADDOW: Congressman Delaney, you'll have some time in a moment on this issue.\n",
      "DELANEY: [inaudible]\n",
      "MADDOW: Congressman Delaney, I'll give you some time in a moment. Mayor DeBlasio is an executive in the largest city in this country. You are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen. If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the United States and Mitch McConnell is still Senate majority leader what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee?\n",
      "DE BLASIO: Rachel, I am chief executive of the nation's largest city and I also want to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question. Look, I run the largest the police force in America too and if we are going to stop these shootings and get these guns off the street we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community. And I also want to say there is something that sets me apart from all of my colleagues running in this race and that is for the last  years I have been raising a black son in America. And I have had to have very, very serious talks with my son Dante, about how to protect himself in the streets of our city and all over our country including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there has been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too—as we saw recently in Indiana. So, we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns but also a different conversation about policing that brings police and community together. We've done that in New York City and we have driven down crime while we've done it. To your question about Mitch McConnell, there's a political solution that we have to come to grips with—if a Democratic Party would stop acting like the party of the elite and be the party of the working people again and go into states including red states to convince people we are on their side we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward [inaudible].\n",
      "MADDOW: Mayor DeBlasio [inaudible].\n",
      "TODD: Senator Warren [inaudible] I'm going to get you. I will get you  seconds. I promise. Let me get this question. We're trying. I know you guys—we got other issues we're trying to get to including a big one coming up in a minute but Senator Warren, I want to continue on the Mitch McConnell thing because you have a lot of ambitious plans. You have a plan for that, ok. We talked about the supreme court. Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell if you don't beat him in the Senate, if he's still sitting there as the Senate majority leader it's very plausible you get elected president with a Republican Senate? Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell?\n",
      "WARREN: I do. We are a democracy and the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters. Now, we for far too long have had a congress in Washington that is just completely dismissed what people care about across this country. They have made this country work much better for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and not made it work for the people. Well, here is how I see this happening—number one, sure I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the Senate. But short of the Democratic majority in the Senate you better understand the fight still goes on. It starts in the White House and it means everybody we energize in  stays on the frontlines come January . We have to push funding outside, have leadership from the inside.\n",

      "TODD: I'm going to get — a couple in here. Thirty seconds, Congressman Delaney you—you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner. Mitch McConnell doesn't operate that way. He operates differently. Why do you think he is going to conform to your style?\n",
      "DELANEY: I think we—we need to get things done. That is why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner. Listen, I will sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party line basis absolutely but all of the big transformative things we have ever done in this country's history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them which is why we need real solutions not impossible promises. We need to put forth ideas that work whether it's on healthcare, creating universal healthcare so that every American gets healthcare but not running on making private insurance a legal. The gun issue is related, the gun safety issue is related because I can't tell you how many times I have been with folks in Western Maryland and they have said to me you know Democrats don't do anything for us, Republicans don't do anything for us. You fight all of the time so they vote on that single issue.\n",

Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?\n",
      "BOOKER: You know when I got to the United States Senate going back to what De Blasio said as an African-American man in an African-American dominated community I knew one of the biggest issues was criminal justice reform from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision then all of the slaves in eighteen fifty and when I got to the Senate people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done. As my colleagues in the Senate know I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate, built coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the first step fact. Is not as far as I want to go but thousands of people will be liberated.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you.\n",
      "BOOKER: I have gotten—I have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and I have been able to get things accomplished.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you, Senator Booker. Rachel has got the next question.\n",
      "MADDOW: We are going to make—hold on, Governor. You are going to be happy with where we go. Governor Inslee this next question is to you. You got me? You got me? You have staked your candidacy on the issue of climate change. It is first, second and third priority for you. You have said it is all of the issues. Let's get specific. We are here in Miami which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise. Parts of Miami Beach and the keys could be underwater in our lifetimes. Does your plan save Miami?\n",
      "INSLEE: Yes, first by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell to start with. We have to do that. Look it—look it, we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last that can do something about it. Our towns are burning, our fields are flooding, Miami is in the dated and we have to understand this is a climate crisis, and emergency and it is our last chance in the administration next one to do something about it and we need to do what I have done in my state. We of passed a one hundred percent clean electrical grid bill. We now have a vision statement and my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work. But the most important thing on this and the biggest decision for the American public is who is going to make this the first priority and I am the candidate and the only one who is saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States so that we can do what we have always done, lead the world and invent the future and put eight million people to work. That's what we're going to do.\n",
      "MADDOW: Governor—Governor Inslee.\n",
      "TODD: Congressman O'Rourke you have also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign. You want some big changes in a pretty short period of time including switching to renewable energy, pushing to replace gas powered cars in favor of electric ones. What is your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you are trying to do but suddenly feels as if government is telling them how to live and ordering them how to live? What is that balance like?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: I think you have got to bring everybody into the decisions and the solutions, to the challenges that we face. That is why we are traveling everywhere listening to everyone. We were in Pacific Junction, a town that had never meaningfully flooded be for just a bit against the Missouri River in Iowa and every home in that community had flooded. There were farms just outside of Pacific Junction that were effectively lakes. Those farmers already underwater in debt. There markets closed to them by trademark under this administration and now they don't know what to do. We and our administration are going to fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We, in our administration, are going to fund resiliency in those communities, in Miami, in Houston, Texas, those places that are on the front lines of climate change today. We're going to mobilize $ trillion in this economy over the next  years. We're going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels. And we're going to put farmers and ranchers in the drivers seat, renewable and—and sustainable agriculture, to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil, paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide. If all of us does all that we can, then we're going to be able to keep this planet from warming another two degrees Celsius and in sure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise that are potential.\n",
      "TODD: Thirty seconds, Secretary Castro. Does—who pays for the mitigation to climate, whether it's building seawalls, for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn't be living? Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that. Do they have to move these people? What do you do about that, where—where maybe they're—they're building a house someplace that is it safe? Who pays to build that house, and how much should the government be bailing them out?\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, I don't think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn't to Iowa or New Hampshire. It was to send one, Puerto Rico —Because people should know that if I'm elected president, everybody will count. And, you know, I'm one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility. We began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables, and also created more than  jobs doing that. And when I was HUD secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition...\n",
      "TODD: Um-hmm\n",
      "CASTRO: ...to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way.\n",
      "TODD: Okay.\n",
      "CASTRO: That's the way that we're going to help to make sure that we're all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change.\n",

      "TODD: Right\n",
      "CASTRO: So that we meet again.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you, Secretary. Congressman Ryan, I got a full question for you here, which is simply this. Your—there are—a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon, taxing carbon in some way. This type of proposal has been tried in a few places, whether it's Washington state where voters voted it down. You have the yellow vest movement. We had an Australia—one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the back of the consumer. If pricing carbon is just politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?\n",
      "RYAN: Well, there—there's a variety of different ways to pay. We talk about different ways of—of raising revenue. And I think we've got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this. But let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics. We could talk about climate. We could talk about guns. We could talk about all of these issues that we all care about. We have a perception problem with the Democratic Party. We are not connecting to the working class people in the very state that I represent in Ohio, in the industrial Midwest. We've lost all connection that—we have got to change the center of gravity of the Democratic Party from being coastal and elital—elitist and Ivy League, which is the perception, to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last  years, to get those workers back on our side so we can say we're going to build electric vehicles, were going to build solar panels. But if you want to beat Mitch McConnell, this better be a working class party. If you want to go into Kentucky and take his rear end out. And if you want to take Lindsay Graham out, you gotta have a blue-collar party that can go into the textile communities.\n",
      "TODD: Okay.\n",
      "RYAN: In South Carolina.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you.\n",

      "TODD: I understand\n",

      "TODD: Thank you, Congressman\n",

      "DELANEY: All the economist agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You can't put a price on carbon raise energy prices and not give the money back to the American people. My proposal which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people, it goes out one pocket back in the other...\n",

      "TODD: Congresswoman Gabbard - move on here. One of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the LGBT community about your past stances and statements on gay rights. After the Trump administration's rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community. Why should voters in that community or voters who care about this issue in general, trust you now?\n",
      "GABBARD: Let me say that there is no one in our government at any level, who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or they should be allowed to marry my record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the equality act. Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today. I've served with LGBTQ service members both in training and deployed downrange. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that I'll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who were unable to find a home for their families. It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address.\n",

      "TODD:  seconds, Senator.\n",
      "BOOKER: Because this is not enough. Look, civil rights is the place to begin. But in the African African-American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African-Americans. We did not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African-American trans Americans And the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We don't talk enough about how many children, about  percent of LGBTQ kids who do not go to school because of fear. It's not enough just to be on the equality act. I'm an original cosponsor. We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you.\n",
      "BOOKER: Every single day from violence in our country.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you, Senator Booker.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Klobuchar, let me put this to you. On the issue of civil rights, for decades,—on the issue of civil rights and demographics, honestly and politics, for decades the Democratic Party has counted on African-American voter turnout as a step one to winning elections on a national level. Democrats are counting on the Latino community now and in the future in the same way. What have you done for black and Latino voters that showed should enthuse them about going to the poles for you if you are your parties nominee?\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: My life and my career and my work and the Senate has been about economic opportunity. And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want to have an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works. You need to have public schools that work, and you also need to make sure that that—those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the stem jobs. In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the  he signed where I was the lead Democrat, okay, that's a first up here, was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs. So to me, this is about a few things. It's about an African-American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swelling, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. It's about the fact that African-American women make $. for every dollar a white man makes. So in short, we need to one, and I will do this in my first  days as president, we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table. Everyone can vote in this country.\n",
      "MADDOW: That's...\n",
      "KLOBUCHAR: And we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform. Senator Booker and I worked on that first step action, but we should go to the second step act, which is to help all our communities across the country.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator, thank you very much. Thirty second follow-up to you, Secretary Castro. This is a  percent Latino city here in Miami. You are the only Latino Democrat who is running this year in the presidential race. Is that enough of an answer? What Senator Klobuchar is describing there, an economic justice agenda, is that enough to mobilize Latino voters to stand with the Democratic Party in a big way?\n",
      "CASTRO: Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice. And you know, I was in Charleston not too long ago and I remembered that Dylan Roof went to the Mother Emmanuel AME church and he murdered nine people who were worshiping and then he was apprehended by police without incident. Well, what but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio Arset? I'm proud that I'm the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter the color of your skin is, that you are treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too often times by police.\n",
      "MADDOW: Secretary Castro, thank you.\n",
      "TODD: Let me go over to Lester Holt who's got a question, I believe a viewer question.\n",
      "HOLT: And I'm over here, Chuck. Thanks.\n",
      "TODD: Where are you here? All right.\n",
      "HOLT: We asked voters across the country to submit their questions to the candidates. Let me read one. This comes from John in New York who submitted this question. He asks does United States have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity? Do we have a responsibility to intervene, to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect American core interests? I'd like to direct that question to Congressman O'Rourke.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: John, I appreciate the—the question. The answer is yes, but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends. When the United States presents a united front, we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer, the kind of genocide that we saw in Rwanda, the kind of genocide we want to stop doing forward. But unfortunately, under this administration, President Trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances. He's diminished our standing in the world and he's made us weaker as a country, less able to confront challenges whether it's Iran or North Korea or Vladimir Putin in Russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in  and who President Trump has offered another invitation to do the same. He's embraced strong men and dictators at the expense of the great democracies. As president, I will make sure that we live our values and our foreign policy. I will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together. That makes America stronger.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: But what about the war Powers act?\n",
      "MADDOW: Thank you, Congressman O'Rourke.\n",
      "DE BLASIO: What about the war powers act being a part of that equation with deep respect to the congressman? Look, we've learned painful lessons as Americans that we have gone to war without congressional authorization. Look this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My add served in the Pacific in World War II in the US Army, battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars both physical and emotional and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life. And that battle didn't kill him but that war did. And look, even in the humanitarian crisis and I think we should be ready, congressman to intervene. God forbid there is a genocide. But not without congressional approval. Democrats and republicans both in the congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without the congressional approval. We learned a lesson in Vietnam. We seemed to have forgotten. The decision have to be made by the United States.\n",
      "MADDOW: [inaudible] I want to pick up this point and I want to give this to Congressman Ryan. Today the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing two American service members in Afghanistan. Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said they want to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan but it isn't over for America. Why isn't it over? Why can't presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there? And how could you?\n",
      "RYAN: I appreciate that question. So I—I've been in Congress  years and  of those years I've sat on the Armed Services Committee either the Defense Appropriations Committee or the Armed Services Committee. And the lesson that I've learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations. Nobody likes it. It's long. It's tedious. But right now we have so I would say we must be engaged in this. We must have our state department engaged. We must have our military engaged to the extent—to the extent they need to be but the reality of it is this president doesn't even have people appointed in the State Department to deal with these things. Whether we're talking about central America, whether we're talking about Iran, whether we're talking about Afghanistan we have got to be completely engaged. And here is why—because these flare ups distract us from the real problems in the country. If we're getting drones shot down for $ million because the President is distracted that's $ million we could be spending in Youngstown, Ohio or Flint Michigan.\n",
      "MADDOW: Congressman Ryan\n",
      "RYAN: [inaudible] we are building or rebuilding.\n",
      "MADDOW: Congresswoman Gabbard, I'm going to give you  seconds actually to jump off what he said. He described [inaudible].\n",
      "GABBARD: Is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan? Well, we just have to be engaged? As a soldier, I will tell you that answer is unacceptable. We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives. We have spent so much money. Money that's coming out of every one of our pockets. Money that should be going into communities here at home. Meeting the needs of the people here at home. We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began. This is why it is so important to have a president — commander in chief who knows the cost of war and is ready to do the job on day one. I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office.\n",

      "TODD: Fair enough. I hear what you're saying. [inaudible]\n",
      "RYAN: I don't want—I don't want to be engaged. I wish we were spending all this money in places I have represented that have been completely forgotten that we were rebuilding. But the reality is if the United States isn't engage the Taliban will grow and they will have bigger, bolder terrorist acts. We have got to have some presence there [inaudible].\n",
      "GABBARD: The Taliban was there long before we came in. They'll be there long before we leave.\n",
      "RYAN: Well...\n",
      "GABBARD: We can't keep U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan thinking that we're going to somehow squash this Taliban that has been there and every other country that's tried it failed.\n",

      "And I mean that. No, I mean that in a that is what this debate is about. This is the best part of—of a debate like this. Congressman over, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by President Trump, House Speaker Pelosi has publicly and privately resisted in the move toward impeachment in the House. If the House chooses not to impeach as president would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mister Mueller's report?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Yes, and I will tell you why.\n",
      "TODD: How by the way if the answer is yes?\n",
      "O'ROURKE: One of the most powerful pieces of art in the United States capital is the Trumbull painting of General George Washington resigning his commission to the Continental Congress at the height of his power submitting to the rule of law and the will of people. That has withstood the test of time for the last two hundred forty-three years. If we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power, a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy, if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand. So we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we followed them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy. And if we have not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our Department of Justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences, there is accountability and there is justice. It is the only way that we save this country.\n",

      "MADDOW: Congressman Delaney, because of the accountability issues that Congressman O'Rourke was just describing their and the real political landscape in which Nancy Pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the house it raises the prospect and the Mueller report raises the prospect that President Trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line. No U.S. president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?\n",

      "DELANEY: Together we are on a mission. We're on a mission to find the America that's been lost, lost through infighting, lost through an action. We're so much better than this. We're a country that used to do things. We saved the world. We created the American dream for millions of people like myself, the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs. But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises. And those are the roots that we have to get back to. I'm running for president to solve these problems, to build infrastructure, to fix our broken health care system, to invest in communities that have been left behind, to improve public education. I just don't want to be your president to be your president.\n",

      "DE BLASIO: It matters, it matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party, that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn't just talk about it but gave people $ minimum wage. It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal healthcare. It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied pre-K and gave it to every single one of them for free. These things really matter. And these are the things that I've done in New York, and I want to do the same for the whole country, because putting working people first, it matters. We need to be that party again. Let's work together. With your help, we can put working people first again in America.\n",

      "INSLEE: Trudi and I have three grandchildren. We love them all. And when I was thinking about whether to run for president, I made a decision. I decided that on my last day on earth I wanted to look them in the eye and tell him I did everything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis. And I know to a moral certainty, if we do not have the next president who commits to this as the top priority it won't get done. And I am the only candidate—frankly, I'm surprised. I am the only candidate who's made this commitment to make up a top priority. If you join me in that recognition of how important this is, we can have a unified national mission. We can save ourselves. We can save our children. We can save our grandchildren. And we can save literally the life on this planet. This is our moment.\n",

      "RYAN: There's—there's nothing worse than not being heard, nothing worse than not being seen. And I know that because I've represented for  years in Congress a forgotten community. They've tried to divide us, who's white, who's black, who's gay, who's straight, who's a man, who's a woman. And they ran away with all the gold because they divided the working class. It's time for us to come together. I don't know how you feel, but I'm ready to place an offense. I come from the middle of industrial America, but these problems are all over our country. There's a tent city in LA. Those homeless people and people around our country who can't afford a home. It's time for us to get back on track. The teacher in Texas, the nurse in New Hampshire, the waitress in Wisconsin, all of us coming together, playing offense with an agenda that lives everybody up.\n",

      "MADDOW: Congresswoman Gabbard, you have  seconds for your closing.\n",
      "GABBARD: You know, our nation was founded on the principles of service above self. People who fled kings who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people coming here to this country, instead of putting in place a government that is of, by, and for the people. But that's not what we have. Instead, we have a government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful. This must end. As president, our White House, our White House will be a beacon of light, providing hope and opportunity, ushering in a new century where every single person will be able to get the healthcare they need, where we will have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, where we will have good paying jobs and a new green economy. Join me in ushering in this new century with peace, prosperity, opportunity, and justice for all.\n",

      "Like many of you I know the promise of America. My grandmother came here when she was seven years old as an immigrant from Mexico and just two generations later one of her grandsons is serving the United States Congress and the other one is running for President of the United States. If I'm elected President I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can get good healthcare, your child can get a good education and you can have good job opportunities whether you live in a big city or a small town. And on January , , we will say adios to Donald Trump.\n",

      "KLOBUCHAR: Three things to know about me. First, I listen to people and that's how I get things done. That is my focus. I have a track record of passing over a hundred bills where I am the lead Democrat and that is because I listened and I acted and I think that's important in a President; everything else just melts away. Secondly, I'm someone that can win and beat Donald Trump. I have won every place, every race and every time. I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over  points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and Michigan. And finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate. I've got respect but I'm not that person. I am the one that doesn't have a political machine that doesn't come from money and I don't make all of the promises that everyone up here makes but I can promise you this, I am going to govern with integrity, I'm going to have your back and I'm going to govern for you.\n",
      "GUTHRIE: Thank you, senator.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: [untranslated]\n",
      "BOOKER: Gracias. Fifty years ago this month my family moved into the town I grew up in because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists that stood up and fought for them. That's the best of who we are as America and why when I got out of law school I moved into the inner city of Newark to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people's rights. I have taken on bullies and beat them. I've taken on tough fights and we've won and we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are but rising to whose best. Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms. We will beat him. I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again. This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him but it's also a referendum on us, who we are and who we must be to each other. It's time we win this election and the way I'll govern is by showing the best of who we are because that's what this country needs and deserves.\n",
      "DIAZ-BALART: Senator thank you. Congressman O'Rourke  seconds.\n",
      "O'ROURKE: Our daughter Molly turned  this week. I'm on this stage for her, for children across this country including some her same age who have been separated from their parents and are sleeping on concrete floors under aluminum blankets tonight. We are going to be there for them. We are going to confront the challenges that we face. We can't return to the same old approach. We are going to need a new kind of politics, one directed by the urgency of the next generation. Those climate activists who are fighting not just for their future but for everyone's. Those students marching not just for their lives but for all of ours. We will need a movement like the one that we led in Texas. It renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in and writing nobody off. That's how we beat Donald Trump and that's how we bring this great country together again. Join us. This is our moment and the generations that follow are counting on us to meet it.\n",
      "TODD: Thank you congressman.\n",
      "MADDOW: Senator Warren you have  seconds for the final, final statement of the evening.\n",
      "WARREN: Thank you. It's a great honor to be here. Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a stage like this. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brother, they all joined the military. I had a dream growing up and my dream was to be a public school teacher. By the time I graduated from high school my family—my family didn't have the money for a college application much less the chance for me to go to college but I got my chance. It was a $ a semester commuter college . That was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl and it opened my life. I am in this fight because I believe that we can make our government, we can make our economy, we can make our country work not just for those at the top; we can make it work for everyone and I promise you this, I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my own family.\n",
