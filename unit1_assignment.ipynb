I would then like all of this information to be organized into a document that I can then use text to speech tools to listen the new output. I am a slow reader, but want to be an incredible PhD student and researcher. I believe that a tool like to this may empower me to digest and understand a lot more research to inform my own work. "

Researchers would be able to use this as a powerful input for their research. This analysis could lead to proxy variables for attitudes about disclsure requirements, tax code changes, as well as firm attitude towards ongoing litigation with which it is involved. "

I am not sure how this information can be useful, but it may be a fun data set with which to work. "

This provides me with an opportunity to be a leader in its use in the field over the coming years. I am attending a conference this next week where I will have the opportunity to pick the brains of some of the leading researchers in this field. There, I will learn more about which data will be the most helpful to analize and the applications for such data. Until then, the two data sets I will be preparing for this assignment are just a starting point. "
