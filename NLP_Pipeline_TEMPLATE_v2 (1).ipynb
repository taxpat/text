The fruits especially should be\\nmade to represent what they speak of, and the Horn\\nof Plenty may be made of pasteboard, decorated with\\ncolored fruits and flowers, or a large waste basket filled\\nwith fruits would do for this purpose. October will be\\npretty crowned with autumn leaves. There will be\\nno difficulty in getting a long, black cape for the\\nWitch, and a pointed black hat. She carries a cane\\nand raps on the floor when ready to recite. Consult\\nany ancient history for costumes for Pomona\\nand her suitors.\\n Scene I\\n[In the woods.]\\nOctober:\\nI am October, my fruits are mellow,\\nMy autumn leaves are red and yellow?\\nI am October, my voice you hear\\nOn Halloween, the fall of the year.\\n[]\\nWitch:\\nSame old jokes on Halloween,\\nSame old pumpkins too are seen;\\nOctober, with your skies so blue,\\nCant you think up something new?\\nOctober:\\nBy my side old Witch please stay,\\nAnd well enact a little play;\\nPomona, goddess of fruits, Ill call,\\nAnd she will entertain us all.\\nVertumnus, too, Ill conjure here,\\nThe god he is, of the turning year!\\nWitch:\\nHa, ha, the story I remember,\\nHe comes long before November;\\nThough many shapes he takes to woo her,\\nNothing ever seems to do her\\nUntil he dons a gossips shoes,\\nFor truly, she is fond of news!\\nOctober:\\nHer attendants well call without delay,\\nFor Pomona now is on her way.\\n[A Trumpeter appears and blows his horn, each\\ntime before a fruit or group of fruits enter.]\\nApples:\\nApples rosy, Apples red,\\nSee us nodding overhead;\\nApples rosy, round and sweet,\\nEverywhere are good to eat.\\n[Dance around in couples, and line up at back of\\nstage.]\\nPears:\\nWe are Pears, so very shy,\\nScarcely nodding to passersby;\\nAs we heard Pomona call,\\nWell do her honor one and all.\\n[Dance in a circle, and line up beside Apples.]\\nBananas:\\nWere Bananas, spick and spandy,\\nAnd you always find us handy;\\nRipe Bananas are so sweet,\\nYou will find us quite a treat.\\n[]\\n[Bow to partners, circle round each other, and line\\nup at back.]\\nGrapes:\\nPurple Grapes, in early fall,\\nWe have heard Pomonas call;\\nAnd we come in late October,\\nFor the summer hours are over.\\n[Join hands, skip forward and back, line up at\\nback.

I care not for\\nyour wild, sweet, spring music.\\n[Vertumnus goes out.
